INTRODUCTION: Over half of patients with Parkinson's disease experience 
psychosis (PDP) symptoms over the course of their disease. In addition to 
significantly impacting patients' health-related quality of life and cognitive 
abilities, these symptoms impact patients' activities of daily living (ADLs) and 
overall functional status. Clinical assessment of how psychosis impacts these 
measures is crucial; however, few studies have assessed functional status among 
patients with PDP. A previous phase 4 study assessing the impact of pimavanserin 
on ADLs in patients with PDP demonstrated that a modified version of the 
Functional Status Questionnaire (mFSQ) could be used for this purpose. This post 
hoc analysis aimed to demonstrate the utility of the mFSQ as a patient-reported 
outcomes tool and to expand on initial study findings by showing the impact of 
pimavanserin on ADLs and functional status for each mFSQ subscale.
METHODS: An analysis of mFSQ data was conducted on patients with PDP treated 
with pimavanserin. This analysis evaluated the least-squares mean (LSM) change 
from baseline to week 16 on the mFSQ by subscale (basic ADL, intermediate ADL, 
psychological function, quality of interaction, and social activity). Pearson's 
correlation was used to assess the relationship between results from the mFSQ 
and the well-established Schwab and England ADL scale.
RESULTS: In this assessment (n = 29), treatment with pimavanserin was associated 
with improvements on all 5 domains of the mFSQ, highlighting a broad improvement 
in ADLs and function. The greatest LSM (SE) improvement was seen in the social 
activity subscale [25.8 (7.52); 95% CI 10.2-41.5; p = 0.0026]. The mFSQ results 
demonstrated positive correlations with patient- and caregiver-rated Schwab and 
England ADL scales.
CONCLUSION: This analysis provides additional information about the impact of 
treatment with pimavanserin on specific mFSQ subscales. Additionally, the mFSQ 
was significantly correlated with the patient- and the caregiver-rated Schwab 
and England ADL scales.

Plain Language Summary: Approximately half of all patients with Parkinson’s 
disease experience hallucinations or delusions. These are symptoms of a 
condition known as Parkinson’s disease psychosis (PDP). PDP impacts patients’ 
activities of daily living (ADLs) and functioning. Pimavanserin is an 
antipsychotic medication used to treat hallucinations and delusions associated 
with PDP. A previous study demonstrated that a newer, self-administered 
questionnaire called the modified Functional Status Questionnaire (mFSQ) can be 
used to evaluate ADLs and functioning in patients with PDP. The current analysis 
aims to understand the impacts of pimavanserin on ADLs and functioning, 
including physical health, psychological well-being, and social activity. We 
measured these using 5 parts (known as “subscales”) of the mFSQ. We used data 
from a previous study of 29 patients with PDP. Patients were treated with 
pimavanserin for 16 weeks. We measured changes in the 5 mFSQ subscales before 
and after treatment. We also measured how well the mFSQ results agreed with the 
results of another, well-established questionnaire (called the Schwab and 
England ADL scale) that also evaluates how well patients perform ADLs and was 
completed by the patients and caregivers. Treatment with pimavanserin was 
associated with improvements on all 5 subscales of the mFSQ. The greatest 
improvements were in the social activity subscale. We also found good agreement 
between the mFSQ and the well-established Schwab and England ADL scale, which 
supports the usefulness of the mFSQ in measuring ADLs and functioning in 
patients with PDP. This analysis is important because it provides additional 
information about the benefit of pimavanserin on ADLs and functioning.

BACKGROUND: In Germany, the approach to treatment optimization for patients with 
advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) is considered somewhat conservative. The 
MANAGE-PD tool ( www.managepd.eu ) was developed to help identify patients with 
advanced PD and to facilitate treatment decision making and appropriate 
allocation of patients to device-aided therapies (DAT). This prospective, 
non-interventional study aimed to investigate the real-world disease burden of 
PD and treatment optimization after MANAGE-PD implementation.
METHODS: Adult PD patients (N = 278) visited specialist clinics and 
neurologist's practices in Germany in 2022. Disease burden was assessed using 
the Unified PD rating scale (UPDRS parts II-IV), the non-motor symptoms scale 
(NMSS) and the 8-item Parkinson's disease Questionnaire (PDQ-8). Data on planned 
treatment changes were collected. Data were analyzed by disease control 
categories according to the MANAGE-PD tool.
RESULTS: Mean scores for motor and non-motor symptoms, quality of life, and 
comorbidity burden were worse in patients with lower disease control measured by 
MANAGE-PD. For 52.8% of patients in Category 2 (inadequately controlled-might 
benefit from oral optimization), no change in oral treatment was planned. No 
change in oral treatment and no DAT initiation was planned for 37.9% and 65.0% 
of patients in Category 3 (inadequately controlled-might benefit from DAT). 
Patient refusal and needing more time to decide were the most common reasons for 
not making treatment changes.
CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the validity of MANAGE-PD by showing its high 
association with disease burden and emphasizes the importance of timely 
provision of necessary information to enable informed decisions about treatment 
optimization.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's 
disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis pose 
significant challenges due to their complex pathophysiology and lack of 
effective treatments. Green tea, rich in the epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) 
polyphenolic component, has demonstrated potential as a neuroprotective agent 
with numerous medicinal applications. EGCG effectively reduces tau and Aβ 
aggregation in ND models, promotes autophagy, and targets key signaling pathways 
like Nrf2-ARE, NF-κB, and MAPK. This review explores the molecular processes 
that underlie EGCG's neuroprotective properties, including its ability to 
regulate mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and 
protein misfolding. Clinical research indicates that EGCG may enhance cognitive 
and motor abilities, potentially inhibiting disease progression despite 
absorption and dose optimization limitations. The substance has been proven to 
slow the amyloidogenic process, prevent protein aggregation, decrease amyloid 
cytotoxicity, inhibit fibrillogenesis, and restructure fibrils for synergistic 
therapeutic effects. The review highlights the potential of EGCG as a natural, 
multi-targeted strategy for NDs but emphasizes the need for further clinical 
trials to enhance its therapeutic efficacy.

The acquisition of suitable stem cell sources is a significant issue in 
regenerative medicine. There has been considerable interest in utilizing 
mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from endometrial and menstrual blood as a 
promising resource of MSCs, owing to their unique biochemical properties and 
prospective use in clinical therapies. This population of stem cells has 
distinct characteristics in terms of immunophenotype, proliferation rate, and 
differentiation capacity. A notable characteristic of these stem cells is their 
capacity to develop into mesodermal lineages, highlighting their regenerative 
capability. Moreover, the presence of certain surface markers facilitates the 
augmentation of clonogenic endometrial MSCs. Their distinctive characteristics, 
along with their swift multiplication ability, underscore their significant 
promise for therapeutic applicability in regenerative medicine and cell-based 
treatments. Current investigations are examining possible usage of diverse stem 
cell resources in the treatment of inflammatory diseases and perhaps intractable 
illnesses like Parkinson's disease, utilizing their immunomodulatory properties. 
This review aims to analyze stem cell-related research that has utilized 
endometrial and menstrual blood-derived MSCs (enMSCs and MenSCs) with a special 
focus on their clinical application. We will explore the existing evidence about 
the therapeutic potential for these stem cells across many medical diseases and 
address the obstacles and prospective trajectories in this domain. Additionally, 
we will study the unique properties of enMSCs and MenSCs that make them 
promising candidates for regenerative medicine.

Early diagnosis by detecting ultralow concentrations of disease biomarkers is 
critical for timely treatment of the two most common neurodegenerative diseases, 
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Innovative biosensors technologies can 
provide accurate, faster, and cheaper diagnostic pathways. In this review, the 
most recent electrochemical and optical sensing and biosensing platforms for 
diagnosing these diseases are critically selected and reviewed. Diagnostic 
targets (generally biomarkers) related to each disease and novel technologies, 
such as nanomaterials and biomolecular techniques to optimize the detection 
process and enhance signals, are discussed. In particular, multiplex detection 
and detection of multiple analytes by a (bio) sensing platform, to improve 
clinical sensitivity and selectivity are considered. This review is intended to 
open new approaches in the field and advance future research by identifying 
those strategies that optimize real-world performance and minimize present 
shortcomings.

ObjectivesCognitive stimulation is a non-pharmacological approach to support 
cognitive and social functioning in people with dementia. This review aimed to 
evaluate the evidence for the feasibility of cognitive stimulation in people 
with non-memory led dementias, and whether adaptations may accommodate 
individuals' primary symptoms.MethodsWe conducted a scoping review, searching 
five databases (PsycINFO, MedLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cinhal Plus) for 
cognitive stimulation studies in people with non-memory led dementias 
specifically.ResultsEight studies met the inclusion criteria, focusing on 
Parkinson's related dementia (N = 7), and posterior cortical atrophy (N = 1). 
The studies included, five quantitative and three mixed-methods designs. Six 
studies reported on the effects of cognitive stimulation interventions on 
domains such as cognition and mood. The findings on cognitive stimulation for 
non-memory led dementias were generally mixed and were limited by studies with 
small sample sizes.ConclusionsThis review indicated the limited research on 
cognitive stimulation interventions for non-memory led dementias, with 
adaptations primarily focussed on just Parkinson's related dementia. Future 
research could expand on existing adaptations for Parkinson's related dementia 
by gathering additional insights from individuals with other non-memory led 
dementias, for example, posterior cortical atrophy, frontotemporal dementia and 
primary progressive aphasia, along with input from their caregivers and dementia 
care professionals. This approach may help adapt cognitive stimulation 
interventions to meet the unique cognitive needs associated with diverse 
dementia profiles.

INTRODUCTION: Bradykinesia affects handwriting and smartphone usage in patients 
with Parkinson's disease (pwPD).
OBJECTIVE: To assess handwriting, hand dexterity, smartphone usage, and 
bradykinesia in pwPD and identify features that best describe upper-limb 
alterations in pwPD.
METHODS: Forty pwPD and 30 age/sex-matched healthy controls were included. We 
used standard handwriting/dexterity tests: Manual-Ability-Measure-36, 
Purdue-Pegboard-Test (PPT) and copy of a text on paper. Spatiotemporal 
handwriting parameters were assessed using tests on a tablet: copy of text and 
pre-writing tasks. To obtain objective data on movement speed and amplitude on 
the smartphone, we developed tests involving the most commonly used gestures 
(tap, swipe, and slide). Bradykinesia during a finger-tapping task was evaluated 
using electromagnetic sensors. Sequential feature selection models were used to 
identify the parameters best distinguishing pwPD and healthy controls.
RESULTS: PwPD relative to healthy controls showed reduced manual ability and 
dexterity. They showed reduced movement amplitude and speed in smartphone tests 
and signs of micrographia during handwriting tests. Moreover, kinematic 
parameters correlated with both PPT and Movement Disorder Society-Unified 
Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III. Each feature selection model demonstrated 
a good accuracy, particularly when including standard handwriting/dexterity 
tests (R2 = 0.90), tests on smartphone (R2 = 0.94) and all the features together 
(R2 = 0.97). The best features were self-reported manual abilities, PPT, tap and 
swipe speed/amplitude on smartphone.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that technological assessments can be added to 
standard evaluations to provide quantitative measures of handwriting, dexterity, 
and bradykinesia that will be useful to assess PD progression and the effects of 
interventions in pwPD.

Reconstructing the nigrostriatal pathway is one of the major challenges in cell 
replacement therapies for Parkinson's disease due to the lack of enabling 
technologies capable of guiding the reinnervation of dopaminergic precursors 
transplanted into the substantia nigra toward the striatum. This paper examines 
nano-pulling, as a technology to enable the remote manipulation of axonal 
growth. Specifically, an organotypic model consisting of co-cultures of the 
substantia nigra and the striatum is developed to demonstrate that when cortical 
neural progenitors are transplanted into the substantia nigra, nano-pulling can 
guide and enhance the elongation of neural projections toward the striatum. To 
provide additional evidence, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived dopaminergic 
progenitor neurospheres are generated and it is shown that nano-pulling can 
induce guided growth and promote the maturation of their neural processes. 
Altogether, this study demonstrates the potential of nano-pulling as an emerging 
technique to promote directed reinnervation within the central nervous system.

Gastrointestinal dysfunction (GID) may play a key role in Parkinson's disease 
(PD) but its relationship with disease progression remains unclear. We recruited 
404 PD cases, 37 iRBD (isolated REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder) and 105 controls. 
Participants completed the Gastrointestinal Dysfunction Scale for PD (GIDS-PD) 
and standardised disease severity assessments. Whole gut transit time (WGTT) was 
measured by ingestion of blue dye and recorded time to blue stools appearance 
('Blue Poop Challenge') in a subset of PD cases. Gastrointestinal symptoms were 
more common and prevalent in iRBD and PD versus controls, and WGTT was 
significantly higher in PD versus controls. After adjustment for confounding 
factors, disease stage was not a significant predictor of GIDS-PD Constipation 
or Bowel Irritability scores. Longitudinal assessment of GIDS-PD scores and WGTT 
confirmed stability over a 4 year period. Bowel dysfunction may be a phenotypic 
feature in a subset of Parkinson's with implications for patient stratification 
and management.

Amyloid aggregation is associated with neurodegenerative disease and its 
modulation is a focus of drug development. We developed a chemical proteomics 
pipeline to probe the mechanism of action of anti-amyloidogenic compounds. Our 
approach identifies putative interaction sites with high resolution, can probe 
compound interactions with specific target conformations and directly in cell 
and brain extracts, and identifies off-targets. We analysed interactions of six 
anti-amyloidogenic compounds and the amyloid binder Thioflavin T with different 
conformations of the Parkinson's disease protein α-Synuclein and tested specific 
compounds in cell or brain lysates. AC Immune compound 2 interacted with 
α-Synuclein in vitro, in intact neurons and in neuronal lysates, reduced 
neuronal α-Synuclein levels in a seeded model, and had protective effects. EGCG, 
Baicalein, ThT and doxycycline interacted with α-Synuclein in vitro but not 
substantially in cell lysates, with many additional putative targets, 
underscoring the importance of testing compounds in situ. Our pipeline will 
enable screening of compounds against any amyloidogenic proteins in cell and 
patient brain extracts and mechanistic studies of compound action.

Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare autosomal-recessive lysosomal disorder caused by 
glucocerebrosidase deficiency. In this study, we described the epidemiology of 
GD in France over more than three decades. The French GD registry (FGDR) 
includes all known patients with GD in France. We described patients' 
characteristics, and estimated the incidence, prevalence, and standardized 
mortality ratios of GD. We compared the evolution of diagnostic methods, 
diagnosis delays, and treatment over time, and assessed the incidence of bone 
events, malignancies, and Parkinson's disease. Between 1980 and 2024, 706 
confirmed GD were included. In 2024, 447 patients were alive (413 type 1, 34 
type 3). GD incidence was 0.21/1 000 000 PY, and GD prevalence was 0.61 and 
0.05/100 000 inhabitants for type 1 and 3, respectively. The standardized 
mortality ratio was 0.70 for type 1 GD and 16.23 for type 3 GD. Over time, we 
observed a decrease in the delay between first symptoms and diagnosis (5.4 years 
before 2000; 0.8 after 2020; p = 0.001), with enzyme assays becoming the primary 
diagnostic method, a reduction in splenectomies, and a gradual increase in the 
use of substrate reduction therapy in type 1 GD. The incidences of bone events, 
malignancies, and Parkinson's disease were 23, 2.7, and 1.07 per 1000 
person-years, respectively. This study provides updated epidemiological data on 
GD in France, showing improvements in disease knowledge, faster and less 
invasive diagnoses, and reassuring outcomes for type 1 GD, with lower mortality 
and a relatively low incidence of malignancies and Parkinson's disease.

Previous resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) analyses of the basal ganglia in 
Parkinson's disease heavily relied on T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) atlases. 
However, subcortical structures are characterized by subtle contrast 
differences, making their accurate delineation challenging on T1WI. In this 
study, we aimed to introduce and validate a method that incorporates 
quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) into the rs-fMRI analytical pipeline 
to achieve precise subcortical nuclei segmentation and improve the stability of 
RSFC measurements in Parkinson's disease. A total of 321 participants (148 
patients with Parkinson's Disease and 173 normal controls) were enrolled. We 
performed cross-modal registration at the individual level for rs-fMRI to QSM 
(FUNC2QSM) and T1WI (FUNC2T1), respectively.The consistency and accuracy of 
resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) measurements in two registration 
approaches were assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient and mutual 
information. Bootstrap analysis was performed to validate the stability of the 
RSFC differences between Parkinson's disease and normal controls. RSFC-based 
machine learning models were constructed for Parkinson's disease classification, 
using optimized hyperparameters (RandomizedSearchCV with 5-fold 
cross-validation). The consistency of RSFC measurements between the two 
registration methods was poor, whereas the QSM-guided approach showed better 
mutual information values, suggesting higher registration accuracy. The 
disruptions of RSFC identified with the QSM-guided approach were more stable and 
reliable, as confirmed by bootstrap analysis. In classification models, the 
QSM-guided method consistently outperformed the T1WI-guided method, achieving 
higher test-set ROC-AUC values (FUNC2QSM: 0.87-0.90, FUNC2T1: 0.67-0.70). The 
QSM-guided approach effectively enhanced the accuracy of subcortical 
segmentation and the stability of RSFC measurement, thus facilitating future 
biomarker development in Parkinson's disease.

Among the symptoms that can occur in Parkinson's disease (PD), Freezing of Gait 
(FOG) is a disabling phenomenon affecting a large proportion of patients, and it 
remains not fully understood. Accurate classification of FOG in PD is crucial 
for tailoring effective interventions and is necessary for a better 
understanding of its underlying mechanisms. In the present work, we applied four 
Machine Learning (ML) classifiers (Decision Tree - DT, Random Forest - RF, 
Multilayer Perceptron - MLP, Logistic Regression - LOG) to different four 
metrics derived from resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
(rs-fMRI) data processing to assess their accuracy in automatically classifying 
PD patients based on the presence or absence of Freezing of Gait (FOG). To 
validate our approach, we applied the same methodologies to distinguish PD 
patients from a group of Healthy Subject (HS). The performance of the four ML 
algorithms was validated by repeated k-fold cross-validation on randomly 
selected independent training and validation subsets. The results showed that 
when discriminating PD from HS, the best performance was achieved using RF 
applied to fractional Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuations (fALFF) data (AUC 
96.8 ± 2 %). Similarly, when discriminating PD-FOG from PD-nFOG, the RF 
algorithm was again the best performer on all four metrics, with AUCs above 
90 %. Finally, trying to unbox how AI system black-box choices were made, we 
extracted features' importance scores for the best-performing method(s) and 
discussed them based on the results obtained to date in rs-fMRI studies on FOG 
in PD and, more generally, in PD. In summary, regions that were more frequently 
selected when differentiating both PD from HS and PD-FOG from PD-nFOG patients 
were mainly relevant to the extrapyramidal system, as well as visual and default 
mode networks. In addition, the salience network and the supplementary motor 
area played an additional major role in differentiating PD-FOG from PD-nFOG 
patients.

Lead, a toxic heavy metal, is prevalent in various industrial applications, 
contributing to environmental contamination and significant health concerns. 
Lead affects various body systems, especially the brain, causing long-lasting 
cognitive and behavioral changes. While most studies have focused on continuous 
lead exposure, intermittent exposure, such as that caused by migration or 
relocations, has received less attention. Importantly, lead exposure intensifies 
the severity of Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies, diseases 
involving the accumulation of alpha-synuclein (aSyn) in the brain and in the 
gut. Although the precise mechanisms underlying these observations remain 
unclear, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction likely play a role. 
Here, we investigated how two different profiles of lead exposure - continuous 
and intermittent - affect models of synucleinopathies. We found that lead 
exposure enhances the formation of aSyn inclusions, resulting in an increase in 
both their number and size in cell models. In addition, we found that animals 
injected with aSyn pre-formed fibrils display serine 129-phosphorylated aSyn 
inclusions and a reduction in astrocytes in the substantia nigra. These animals 
also display neuronal damage and alterations in locomotor activity, exploration 
behavior, anxiety, memory impairments and hypertension. Our results suggest a 
mechanistic link between environmental lead exposure and the onset and 
progression of diseases associated with aSyn pathology. Understanding the 
molecular and cellular interactions between lead and aSyn is crucial for shaping 
public health policies and may provide novel insight into strategies for 
mitigating the impact of environmental toxins on neurodegenerative processes 
involved in Parkinson's disease and related synucleinopathies.

Regulatory modules are molecules that interact functionally, driving disease 
processes. Here, we present a protocol for identifying regulatory modules in 
Parkinson's disease (PD) using cohort-specific microRNA (miRNA) data and Boolean 
modeling. We describe steps for omics data collection, biomolecule and miRNA 
target analysis, and Boolean model construction and simulation. We then detail 
procedures for validation of the model and results. The modules identified using 
this protocol explain how miRNA-driven mechanisms influence PD progression in 
disease cohorts. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, 
please refer to Hemedan et al.1.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), like Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's 
disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 
(ALS), present an increasingly significant global health burden, primarily due 
to the lack of effective early diagnostic tools and treatments. 
Exosomes-nano-sized extracellular vesicles secreted by nearly all cell 
types-have emerged as promising candidates for both biomarkers and therapeutic 
agents in NDs. This review examines the biogenesis, molecular composition, and 
diverse functions of exosomes in NDs. Exosomes play a crucial role in mediating 
intercellular communication. They are capable of reflecting the biochemical 
state of their parent cells and have the ability to cross the blood-brain 
barrier (BBB). In doing so, they facilitate the propagation of pathological 
proteins, such as amyloid-beta (Aβ), tau, and alpha-synuclein (α-syn), while 
also enabling the targeted delivery of neuroprotective compounds. Recent 
advancements in exosome isolation and engineering have opened up new 
possibilities for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. These range from the 
discovery of non-invasive biomarkers to innovative approaches in gene therapy 
and drug delivery systems. However, challenges related to standardization, 
safety, and long-term effects must be addressed before exosomes can be 
translated into clinical applications. This review highlights both the promising 
potential and the obstacles that must be overcome to leverage exosomes in the 
treatment of NDs and the transformation of personalized medicine.

BACKGROUND: Dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS) is a debilitating complication 
of Parkinson's disease (PD) dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) in which patients 
pathologically and/or compulsively use dopaminergic drugs to treat motor 
symptoms. Studies examining DDS outcomes following deep brain stimulation (DBS) 
are limited and have focused on subthalamic targeting.
CASES: Here, we present DDS outcomes in six patients from the Emory Movement 
Disorders clinic who underwent unilateral or bilateral DBS implantation of the 
globus pallidus internus (GPi). Despite motor improvements and/or initial 
reductions in DRT dosing, all six patients continued to meet clinical criteria 
for DDS 6 months post-surgery, displaying persistent pathological medication 
use, mood disturbances, and social impairment. Anxiety surrounding levodopa use 
was the most persistent DDS feature following surgery.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that pallidal DBS is not a suitable treatment 
for DDS and its associated symptoms.

Polyphenols have been reported to have a multi-targeted neuroprotective effect 
on Parkinson's disease (PD). However, there has been no comprehensive analysis 
of the effect of polyphenol therapy on improving motor symptoms in PD. We used 
keywords to search the electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, EBSCO, SpringerLink, 
China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wan Fang and Web of Science from 
the establishment of the database to April 2023. A randomized effects model 
systematic review and meta-analysis of 83 included studies were conducted to 
investigate the ameliorative effects of polyphenols on 
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced motor dysfunction in 
a rodent model of PD. The results showed that compared with PD control group, 
polyphenols significantly improved balance, exploration, vertical crawling, 
horizontal crawling, muscle strength and sensorimotor function motor dysfunction 
of rodents. Subgroup analysis showed that the types of polyphenols had different 
recovery effects on motor symptoms of PD. Oral polyphenol intervention was 
superior to intraperitoneal and intravenous administration. This meta-analysis 
provides comprehensive evidence for the prevention or treatment of Parkinson's 
motor symptoms with polyphenols and expands the idea of future clinical 
application of polyphenols.

INTRODUCTION: Cognitively unimpaired (CU) amyloid beta (Aβ)+ individuals with 
elevated plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) have an increased risk of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related progression. We tested the utility of plasma 
GFAP for population enrichment CU populations in clinical trials.
METHODS: We estimated longitudinal progression, effect size, and costs of 
hypothetical clinical trials designed to test an estimated 25% drug effect on 
reducing tau positron emission tomography (PET) accumulation in the medial 
temporal lobe (MTL) and temporal neocortical region (NEO-T).
RESULTS: CU GFAP+/Aβ+ individuals present an increased annual rate of change and 
effect size in tau PETMTL and tau PETNEO-T compared to the other groups. An 
enrichment strategy selecting CU GFAP+/Aβ+ individuals would require a smaller 
sample size (≈ 57% reduction) and fewer Aβ PET scans (≈ 74% reduction) than 
trials enriched with Aβ PET alone, reducing total clinical trial costs by up to 
64%.
DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that clinical trials focusing on preclinical AD 
recruiting Aβ+ individuals with elevated GFAP levels would improve cost 
effectiveness.
HIGHLIGHTS: Cognitively unimpaired (CU) glial fibrillary acidic protein 
(GFAP)+/amyloid beta (Aβ)+ shows increased changes in tau positron emission 
tomography (PET) . CU GFAP+/Aβ+ enriched clinical trials require a reduced 
sample size compared to Aβ+ only. CU GFAP+/Aβ+ enrichment reduces Aβ PET scans 
required and costs. CU GFAP+/Aβ+ enrichment allows the selection of individuals 
at early stages of the Alzheimer's disease continuum.

BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurological disorder 
characterized by the progressive degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) 
neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). This degeneration disrupts the basal 
ganglia loops, leading to both motor and non-motor dysfunctions. Cell therapy 
for PD aims to replace lost mDA neurons to restore the DA neurotransmission in 
the denervated forebrain targets. In clinical trials for PD, mDA neurons are 
implanted into the target area, the striatum, and not in the SN where they are 
normally located. This ectopic localisation of cells may affect the 
functionality of transplanted neurons due to the absence of appropriate host 
afferent regulation. We recently demonstrated that human induced pluripotent 
stem cells (hiPSCs) derived mDA progenitors grafted into the substantia nigra 
pars compacta (SNpc) in a mouse model of PD, differentiated into mature mDA 
neurons, restored the degenerated nigrostriatal pathway, and induced motor 
recovery. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the long-term 
functionality of these intranigral-grafted mDA neurons by assessing their 
electrophysiological properties.
METHODS: We performed intranigral transplantation of hiPSC-derived mDA 
progenitors in a 6-hydroxydopamine RAG2-KO mouse model of PD. We recorded in 
vivo unit extracellular activity of grafted mDA neurons in anesthetised mice 
from 9 to 12 months post-transplantation. Their electrophysiological properties, 
including firing rates, patterns and spike characteristics, were analysed and 
compared with those of native nigral dopaminergic neurons from control mice.
RESULTS: We demonstrated that these grafted mDA neurons exhibited functional 
characteristics similar to those of native nigral dopaminergic neurons, such as 
large bi- or triphasic spike waveforms, low firing rates, pacemaker-like 
properties, and two single-spike firing patterns. Although grafted mDA neurons 
also displayed low discharge frequencies below 10 Hz, their mean frequency was 
significantly lower than that of nigral mDA neurons, with a differential pattern 
distribution.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that grafted mDA neurons exhibit 
dopaminergic-like functional properties, including intrinsic membrane potential 
oscillations leading to regular firing patterns. Additionally, they demonstrated 
irregular and burst firing patterns, suggesting they receive modulatory inputs. 
However, grafted mDA neurons displayed distinct properties, potentially related 
to their human origin or the incomplete maturation one year after 
transplantation.

BACKGROUND: Temperatures across Africa are expected to rise at up to twice the 
rate of mean global temperatures, posing significant health threats to 
vulnerable communities. Prolonged exposure to high day- and night-time 
temperatures has been implicated in a myriad of adverse health outcomes. The 
built environment and inadequate housing can exacerbate these consequences, 
prompting the need to evaluate heat adaptation interventions as a sustainable 
adaptation strategy for low-income and informal settlement dwellers. The Heat 
Adaptation Benefits for Vulnerable groups In Africa (HABVIA) study aims to 
assess the impact of passive cooling interventions in homes on several key 
physiologic and mental health outcomes, as well as building internal thermal 
conditions.
METHODS: HABVIA is a 3-year prospective controlled study to identify, implement 
and assess heat adaptation solutions in four low-income communities in one urban 
and one rural site in Ghana and South Africa, respectively. In each site, N=240 
participants (N=60 per site) will be assigned to intervention or control groups. 
The intervention is focused on lowering the nighttime temperature of the home 
environment. Health and biometric data will be collected through a combination 
of physiological measurements, questionnaires, and biochemical measures taken at 
3 time points during the hot season. Clinical outcomes include objective sleep 
behaviour, core body temperature, physical activity, blood pressure, blood 
glucose, anthropometrics, and body composition. Indoor and outdoor environmental 
data will be collected continuously using fixed indoor sensors and automatic 
weather stations. Housing and community characteristics, and socio-economic 
information will be collected. Quantitative comparisons will be made between 
intervention and control conditions using generalised linear mixed models. 
Qualitative data from consultive workshops will be used to assess the 
acceptability and feasibility of the adaptations.
DISCUSSION: Robust evaluation of the environmental and health outcomes of heat 
adaptations are limited for Africa, despite high climate vulnerability. HABVIA 
will address some of these gaps by assessing low-cost passive cooling 
interventions to promote heat resilience and improve health outcomes, providing 
real-world evidence for the feasibility of readily implementable and scalable 
adaptations in local contexts.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to use deep learning (DL) techniques to accurately 
differentiate Parkinson's disease (PD) from multiple system atrophy (MSA), which 
share similar clinical presentations. In this retrospective analysis, 206 
patients who underwent PET/MR imaging at the Chinese PLA General Hospital were 
included, having been clinically diagnosed with either PD or MSA; an additional 
38 healthy volunteers served as normal controls (NC). All subjects were randomly 
assigned to the training and test sets at a ratio of 7:3. The input to the model 
consists of 10 two-dimensional (2D) slices in axial, coronal, and sagittal 
planes from multi-modal images. A modified Residual Block Network with 18 layers 
(ResNet18) was trained with different modal images, to classify PD, MSA, and NC. 
A four-fold cross-validation method was applied in the training set. Performance 
evaluations included accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, Receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC), and area under the ROC curve (AUC).
RESULTS: Six single-modal models and seven multi-modal models were trained and 
tested. The PET models outperformed MRI models. The 
11C-methyl-N-2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-fluorophenyl)-tropanel (11C-CFT) -Apparent 
Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) model showed the best classification, which resulted 
in 0.97 accuracy, 0.93 precision, 0.95 recall, 0.92 F1, and 0.96 AUC. In the 
test set, the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of the CFT-ADC model 
were 0.70, 0.73, 0.93, and 0.82, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed DL method shows potential as a high-performance 
assisting tool for the accurate diagnosis of PD and MSA. A multi-modal and 
multi-sequence model could further enhance the ability to classify PD.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms adjacent to the 
α-amino-β-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde decarboxylase (ACMSD) gene have been 
associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) in genome-wide association studies 
(GWAS). However, its biological validation as a PD risk gene has been hampered 
by the lack of available models. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we generated a zebrafish 
model of acmsd deficiency with marked increase in quinolinic acid. Despite this, 
acmsd-/- zebrafish were viable, fertile, morphologically normal and demonstrated 
no abnormalities in spontaneous movement. In contrast to the postulated 
pro-immune pathomechanism linking ACMSD to PD, microglial cells and expression 
of the proinflammatory cytokines cxcl8, il-1β, and mmp9 were similar between 
acmsd-/- and controls. The number of ascending dopaminergic neurons, and their 
susceptibility to MPP+, was also indistinguishable. An upregulation of 
kynurenine aminotransferase activity was identified in acmsd-/- zebrafish which 
may explain the absence of neurodegenerative phenotypes. Our study highlights 
the importance of biological validation for putative GWAS hits in suitable model 
systems.

Individual cognitive profiles of patients with Parkinson's disease dementia 
(PDD) are highly heterogeneous, suggesting possible biological subtypes. We 
studied 75 PD patients who developed dementia in the course of the Parkinson's 
Progression Markers Initiative study to investigate data-driven evidence for the 
existence of distinct cognitive subtypes of PDD. Using Ward's hierarchical 
clustering on neuropsychological test data, we identified two distinct cognitive 
subtypes. Despite similar dementia severity (MoCA: 20.6 vs 20.0), cluster-A 
exhibited more pronounced memory deficits (n = 50), whereas cluster-B showed 
greater visuospatial impairments (n = 25). The subtypes did not differ in 
demographic, motor, or MRI-based neurodegeneration measures. However, the 
visuospatial-predominant cluster-B had a higher prevalence of GBA mutations 
(p = 0.003) and hallucinations (p = 0.009). No differences were found in APOE-ε4 
prevalence or cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of Alzheimer's pathology. These 
findings reveal distinct memory-predominant and visuospatial-predominant PDD 
subtypes, which associate with different clinical and genetic features but are 
independent of comorbid Alzheimer's pathology.

Recent studies have suggested a potential but inconsistent link between UQCRC1 
and Parkinson's disease (PD). For the first time, we systematically investigated 
the association between non-synonymous variants in UQCRC1 and PD risk using data 
from the UK Biobank with half-million participants, which provide evidence 
supporting the role of UQCRC1 Protein-truncating variants (PTVs) in PD 
(P = 1.20 × 10-6, OR = 6.59) and highlight the importance of large-scale 
population studies in identifying rare genetic risk factors.

Only the timely detection of individuals with incipient α-synucleinopathies can 
pave the way for developing disease-modifying therapies. Our aim was to explore 
the views of individuals with isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD), 
actively recruited from the general population, on the ethical justifiability of 
active recruitment and their experiences with risk disclosure. This 
mixed-methods study surveyed individuals with iRBD, confirmed by 
video-polysomnography, utilizing an interdisciplinary-developed online 
questionnaire. Of 99 invited individuals, 75 (75.8%) answered the survey. While 
55.6% experienced the information on the increased risk as burdensome, 63.9% 
supported risk disclosure if consent had been obtained beforehand. Almost all 
individuals (96.2%) regarded our active recruitment method as appropriate, and 
86.7% indicated they would participate again. Open-text responses indicated that 
key motivations included access to information and care, and contributing to 
research progress. This well-received recruitment strategy could serve as a 
model for future screening initiatives in α-synucleinopathy research.

Urinary symptoms suggestive of overactive bladder are common nonmotor symptoms 
associated with Parkinson disease (PD) that increase burden of living with PD as 
well as the risk of falls and institutionalization. Emerging evidence suggests 
lifestyle and behavioral therapies including pelvic floor muscle exercise-based 
treatments are reasonable initial strategies. When considering medication-based 
therapies clinicians should assess for common comorbid conditions such as falls, 
constipation, sleep disturbance, and orthostatic hypotension, which may 
influence the potential for adverse drug events. If considering surgical 
interventions, it is important to distinguish idiopathic PD from other 
parkinsonian conditions such as multiple system atrophy, to optimize outcomes.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by the gradual 
deterioration of dopaminergic neurons in the brain and the presence of Lewy 
bodies (LB) within the remaining affected neurons, comprised of α-synuclein 
protein aggregates. Herein, we report a novel amyloid inhibitory potential of 
Parishin C on the amyloid transformation of the α-synuclein protein. Our studies 
involving computational screening and REMD simulation analysis revealed a strong 
interaction between Parishin C and the non-amyloid component (NAC domain), a 
known aggregation-prone region of the α-synuclein protein. Thioflavin T 
fluorescence assay demonstrated the inhibitory effect of Parishin C on amyloid 
transformation kinetics of α-synuclein, where even at the lowest concentration 
of Parishin C there was a 72 % reduction in the ThT maxima. ANS binding assay 
further revealed its ability to alter the surface hydrophobicity of the protein. 
An extensive evaluation using biophysical techniques indicated that Parishin C 
effectively prevented the formation of mature fibrillar species and promoted the 
formation of lower order aggregates with reduced cross-β-sheet signatures 
compared to the native α-synuclein aggregates. Collectively, our research 
highlights Parishin C's potential as a structural blueprint for developing new 
therapeutic compounds aimed at preventing the amyloidogenic transition in 
Parkinson's disease and related disorders.

BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence indicates that individuals with Type 2 Diabetes 
Mellitus (T2DM) are at an elevated risk of Parkinson's Disease (PD). While 
mortality trends for each condition have been studied individually, the combined 
burden of T2DM- and PD-related mortality remains poorly understood. This study 
aims to evaluate national trends and disparities in T2DM and PD related 
mortality among older adults in the United States (U.S.). from 1999 to 2020.
METHODS: Using CDC WONDER database, we analyzed deaths among U.S. residents aged 
65 + from 1999 to 2020, identifying T2DM (ICD-10: E11) and PD (ICD-10: G20) 
related deaths. Crude and age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMR) per 100,000 
individuals were calculated, and Joinpoint regression analysis was employed to 
estimate the annual percent change (APC).
RESULTS: Between 1999 and 2020, a total of 26,020 deaths occurred among older 
adults with T2DM and PD. The AAMR increased from 1.65 in 1999 to 5.61 in 2020, 
with a sharp rise between 2015 and 2020 (APC: +14.42 %; 95 % CI: 11.22 to 
20.80). Males experienced higher AAMRs than females (4.51 vs. 1.80). Across 
racial groups, Hispanic or Latino individuals exhibited the highest AAMR (3.61), 
while non-Hispanic Black Americans had the lowest (1.96). Non-metropolitan areas 
experienced higher AAMRs than metropolitan areas (3.64 vs. 2.71).
CONCLUSIONS: T2DM and PD-related mortality has surged over the past two decades, 
particularly since 2015, with significant racial, sex-based, and regional 
disparities. Targeted public health strategies are needed to address these 
growing health concerns.

Loss of function of parkin leads to the mitochondrial dysfunction, which is 
closely related to Parkinson's disease. However, the in vivo mechanism is far 
from clear. One of the dogmas is that impaired Parkin causes dysfunction of 
mitophagy mediated by Pink1-Parkin axis. The other is that impaired Parkin 
causes Mfn accumulation which leads to mitochondrial dysfunction. Surprisingly, 
in Drosophila muscles, as reported, the first dogma is not applicable; for the 
second dogma, our study suggests that Parkin mediates the mitochondrial 
dysfunction through modulating mitochondrial morphology, which is determined by 
synergy of both Marf and mitochondrial protein mRpL18 got from our genome-wide 
screen, whose RNAi rescues parkin RNAi phenotype. Mechanistically, we found that 
impaired Parkin upregulated both the transcription and protein levels of mRpL18 
dependent on its E3 ligase activity, causing the mRpL18 accumulation outside 
mitochondria. Consequently, cytosolic accumulated mRpL18 competitively bound 
Drp1, leading to the reduction of the binding of Drp1 to its receptor Fis1, 
which finally inhibited the mitochondrial fission and tipped the balance to 
mitochondrial hyperfusion, thereby affected the mitochondrial function. Taken 
together, our study suggests that impaired Parkin causes mitochondrial 
hyperfusion due to two reasons: (1) Parkin defect impairs Pink1-Parkin 
axis-mediated Marf degradation, which promotes mitochondrial fusion; (2) Parkin 
defect causes mRpL18 accumulation, which inhibits Drp1/Fis1-mediated 
mitochondrial fission. These two ways function together to drive Parkin-mediated 
mitochondrial hyperfusion. Therefore, knockdown of either marf or mRpL18 can 
prevent mitochondrial hyperfusion, leading to the rescue of Parkin 
defect-triggered fly wing phenotypes. Overall, our study unveils a new facet of 
how Parkin regulates mitochondrial morphology to affect mitochondrial function, 
which provides new insights for the understanding and treatment of Parkinson's 
disease.

Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by the selective loss of nigral 
dopaminergic neurons, is a common neurodegenerative disorder for which effective 
disease-modifying therapies remain unavailable. Rapamycin, a clinical 
immunosuppressant used for decades, has demonstrated neuroprotective effects in 
various animal models of neurological diseases, including PD. These effects are 
believed to be mediated through the inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin 
(mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, with rapamycin binding to FKBP12. However, 
recent studies have suggested that mTOR activation can be neuroprotective in 
degenerating dopaminergic neurons, presenting a paradox to the neuroprotective 
mechanism of rapamycin via mTORC1 inhibition. In this study, we showed that 
mTORC1 signaling was inactivated in nigral dopaminergic neurons in the 
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD. Notably, 
the optimal neuroprotective dose of rapamycin did not inhibit mTORC1 signaling 
nor restore autophagy defects in nigral dopaminergic neurons of MPTP-treated 
male C57BL/6 mice. Furthermore, acute Raptor knockout in dopaminergic neurons, 
which abolishes mTORC1 activity, did not diminish rapamycin's neuroprotective 
effects, suggesting that its protection is independent of mTORC1 inhibition. 
Importantly, rapamycin is also a potent inhibitor of FKBP12, a peptidyl-prolyl 
cis-trans isomerase highly expressed in the brain. Selective knockdown of FKBP12 
in nigral dopaminergic neurons confers neuroprotective effects comparable to 
that of rapamycin, with no synergism observed when the two are combined. 
Collectively, our results indicate that rapamycin exerts neuroprotective effects 
in parkinsonian mice through inhibition of FKBP12 rather than mTORC1 signaling. 
These findings suggest that FKBP12 may serve as a novel target for 
disease-modifying therapies in PD.

Depression in Parkinson's disease (dPD) is a prevalent comorbidity significantly 
impairing patients' quality of life. Emerging evidence highlights the pivotal 
role of neuroinflammation in dPD pathogenesis, particularly the interaction 
between neuronal pyroptosis and microglial polarization. Serotonin 
(5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has been implicated in mood regulation and 
neuroinflammatory processes, yet its role in modulating pyroptosis and 
microglial polarization remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to 
investigate neuronal pyroptosis and microglial polarization in dPD pathogenesis 
and explore the regulation of 5-HT on these processes. A C57BL/6 mouse model of 
dPD was established using injected intraperitoneally of rotenone to observe 
changes in body weight, sucrose preference, and exercise time. ELISA and Western 
blotting were used to detect the expression of relevant proteins and cytokines 
in the hippocampus. Co-culture experiments with HT22 and BV2 cells were 
conducted to explore the effect of 5-HT on neuronal pyroptosis and microglial 
polarization. Rotenone-induced dPD in mice led to reduced body weight, sucrose 
preference, and activity, accompanied by upregulation of pyroptosis markers 
(NLRP1, N-GSDMD, Cleaved-caspase-1) and increased M1 microglial polarization. 
Treatment with 5-HT and the pyroptosis inhibitor Pep19-2.5 reversed these 
changes, mitigating neuronal pyroptosis and shifting microglial polarization 
towards a less inflammatory profile. In vitro, 5-HTP suppressed LPS-induced 
neuronal pyroptosis, reducing TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-18 levels and oxidative stress 
while preserving microglial viability. The 5-HT inhibitor Scopolamine abolished 
these effects. Neuronal pyroptosis and M1 microglial polarization contribute 
critically to dPD pathogenesis. By inhibiting these processes, 5-HT emerges as a 
promising therapeutic target for managing dPD, offering new insights into its 
treatment mechanisms.

The tear film is a complex structure with rich interactions with the human body. 
A growing body of evidence suggests that measuring changes in protein, lipid, or 
other metabolite concentration in the tear film can be used to help detect 
disease. Particularly in the era of precision medicine, the tear film serves as 
a promising source of non-invasive insights into systemic health for early 
diagnosis and treatment. This paper analyzes the latest research in tear film 
biomarkers for systemic diseases. The review was conducted through PubMed and 
Embase databases using the PRISMA protocol and includes 54 articles. This paper 
first reviews the anatomy and physiology of tear film, as well as the latest 
proteomic analysis techniques on the tear film. We then provide a 
disease-by-disease review on the tear film as a biomarker including 5 articles 
related to Alzheimer's Disease, 10 articles related to Cancers, 1 article 
related to Cystic Fibrosis, 1 article related to Migraines, 4 articles related 
to Multiple Sclerosis, 15 articles related to Parkinson's Disease, 7 articles 
related to Rheumatoid Arthritis, and 11 articles related to Thyroid Disease. 
This paper highlights the promising results of these studies yet also reviews 
the challenges with limited sample sizes, reproducibility, and biological 
understanding of biomarkers. We conclude this paper with insights for future 
work to ensure clinical validity and generalizability. Ultimately, the tear film 
is a clinically accessible, complex structure that provides a wealth of 
information that may contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of 
systemic health.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is recognized as a systemic condition, with clinical 
features potentially modifiable by dietary intervention. Diets high in saturated 
fats and refined sugars significantly increase PD risk and exacerbate motor and 
non-motor symptoms, yet precise metabolic mechanisms are unclear. To investigate 
the interplay between diet and PD, we used a model of early-onset PD under 
chronic glycative stress induced by prolonged high-fat high-sucrose (HFHS) diet. 
We found this obesogenic diet drives loss of fat and muscle mass in early-onset 
PD mice, with a selective vulnerability of glycolytic myofibers. We show that PD 
mice and early-onset familial PD patients are under pervasive glycative stress 
with pathological accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), 
including two previously unknown glycerinyl-AGE markers.

Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) is gaining attention as a key therapeutic 
target for autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (PD). The primary genetic 
aetiology of familial PD, accounting for around 5-6 % of familial cases and 2 % 
of sporadic cases, is mutations in the LRRK2 gene. The most prevalent mutation, 
G2019S, increases kinase activity, which phosphorylates important serine 
residues that control LRRK2 function, such as Ser910 and Ser935, leading to the 
development of PD. The development of LRRK2 inhibitors has emerged as a key area 
of study for PD therapy. In preclinical research, these inhibitors have 
demonstrated promise in reducing PD-related damage by altering the cellular 
localisation of LRRK2 and reduced phosphorylation. In addition to kinase action, 
LRRK2 is involved in autophagy and mitochondrial function. This participation 
implies that PD markers including mitochondrial dysfunction and defective 
autophagy may be addressed by LRRK2-targeted treatments. Moreover, selective 
LRRK2 inhibitors show promise in the treatment of PD, and more research into the 
molecular role of LRRK2 in PD is essential to developing efficient therapies 
that will improve patient outcomes and reduce the course of the illness. This 
review discusses the role of LRRK2 in pathogenesis of PD and current treatment 
approaches, particularly LRRK2 kinase inhibitors, and their potential to slow 
disease progression, along with recent advancements in clinical trials and 
future outlooks for improving outcomes in PD.

BACKGROUND: Sleep disturbances are common non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's 
disease (PD), negatively affecting daily functioning, exacerbating motor 
symptoms, and contributing to cognitive impairment. However, the underlying 
neurobiological mechanisms are not well understood. This study utilized 
resting-state and task-based functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to 
explore how sleep disturbances affect brain function in PD patients at the 
neural level.
METHODS: Sixty PD patients were recruited, including 30 with sleep disturbances 
and 30 without. Resting-state fNIRS and clinical assessments were used to 
analyze spontaneous brain activity and functional connectivity. We also examined 
the mediating role of brain activity in the relationship between sleep 
disturbances and motor symptoms. The verbal fluency test (VFT) was employed to 
investigate changes in brain mechanisms related to executive function in 
patients with sleep disturbances.
RESULTS: Resting-state analysis revealed significantly increased fractional 
amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) in the medial prefrontal cortex 
(mPFC) in PD patients with sleep disturbances. fALFF values were negatively 
correlated with sleep quality and positively with motor symptom severity. 
Mediation analysis indicated that spontaneous neural activity in the mPFC 
partially mediated the relationship between sleep disturbances and motor 
symptoms. Task-based analysis showed reduced activation in the mPFC and 
orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) during the VFT in patients with sleep disturbances, 
indicating impaired executive function.
CONCLUSION: Sleep disturbances in PD could be associated with exacerbated motor 
symptoms and may impair executive function by affecting spontaneous and 
task-related neural activity in the mPFC. These findings highlight mPFC 
dysfunction as a potential biomarker for targeted therapies.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (GRA) belong to a class of 
compounds that reduce blood glucose and energy intake by simulating actions of 
endogenous incretin hormone GLP-1 after it is released by the gut following food 
consumption. They are used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity 
and have systemic effects on various organs, including the brain, liver, 
pancreas, heart, and the gut. Patients with T2DM have a higher risk of 
developing neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), including Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Huntington's 
disease (HD), accompanied by more severe motor deficits and faster disease 
progression, suggesting dysregulation of insulin signaling in these diseases. 
Experimental studies have shown that GRA have protective effects to modulate 
neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial and autophagic functions, and 
protein misfolding. Hence the compounds have generated enormous interest as 
novel therapeutic agents against NDs. To date, clinical trials have shown that 
three GRA, exenatide, liraglutide and lixisenatide can improve motor deficits as 
an add-on therapy in PD patients and liraglutide can improve cognitive function 
in AD patients. The neuroprotective effects of these and other GRA, such as 
PT320 (a sustained-released exenatide) and semaglutide, are still under 
investigation. The dual GLP-1/gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) receptor 
agonists have been demonstrated to have beneficial effects in AD and PD mice 
models. Overall, GRA are highly promising novel drugs, but future clinical 
studies should identify which subsets of patients should be targeted as 
potential candidates for their symptomatic and/or neuroprotective benefits, 
investigate whether combinations with other classes of drugs can further augment 
their efficacy, and evaluate their long-term disease-modifying and adverse 
effects.

BACKGROUND: The gut microbiome is altered in MS and may contribute to disease by 
disrupting the intestinal barrier. The colonic mucus barrier, which is primarily 
composed of mucin protein 2 (MUC2), plays a crucial role in providing a barrier 
between colonic epithelial cells and the microbiome. Disruption of intestinal 
epithelial and mucus barriers has been reported in inflammatory bowel disease 
(IBD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) but has not been studied in the context of 
the microbiome in multiple sclerosis (MS).
METHODS: We investigated the epithelial tight junction protein zonulin occludins 
1 (ZO-1), mucus protein MUC2, inflammatory stool markers (calprotectin), and gut 
microbiota composition in a cohort of subjects with relapsing and progressive 
MS.
FINDINGS: MUC2 was decreased in stool of subjects with both relapsing and 
progressive MS. ZO-1 was elevated in the serum of subjects with progressive MS 
but was not altered in the stool. Inflammatory markers typically elevated in IBD 
and PD, including calprotectin, were not altered in MS stool, suggesting disease 
specificity of altered gut physiology in MS. Microbiota with known mucus 
degrading capacity were elevated in the stool of subjects with MS and negatively 
correlated with mucus protein levels.
INTERPRETATION: Taken together, these findings suggest reduced gut barrier 
function in MS which is linked to increased mucin degrading bacteria.

BACKGROUND: Recent technological advances in wearable devices offer new 
potential for measuring mobility in real-world contexts. Mobilise-D has 
validated digital mobility outcomes to provide novel outcomes and end points in 
clinical research of 4 different long-term health conditions (Parkinson disease, 
multiple sclerosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and proximal femoral 
fracture). These outcomes also provide unique information that is important to 
patients; however, there is limited literature that explores the optimal methods 
to achieve this, such as the best way to visualize patients' data.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify meaningful outcomes for each condition 
and how to best visualize them from the perspective of end users.
METHODS: Using a Delphi-type protocol with patients as subject matter experts, 
we gathered iterative feedback on the cocreation of visualizations through 3 
rounds of questionnaires. An open-ended questionnaire was used in round 1 to 
understand what aspects of mobility were most influenced by their health 
condition. These responses were mapped onto relevant digital mobility outcomes 
and walking experiences and then prioritized for visualization. Using patient 
responses, we worked alongside researchers, clinicians, and a patient advisory 
group to develop visualizations that depicted a week of mobility data. During 
rounds 2 and 3, participants rated usefulness and ease of understanding on a 
5-point Likert scale and provided unstructured feedback in comment boxes for 
each visualization. Visualizations were refined using the feedback from round 2 
before receiving further feedback in round 3.
RESULTS: Participation varied across rounds 1 to 3 (n=48, n=79, and n=78, 
respectively). Round 1 identified important outcomes and contexts for each 
health condition, such as walking speed and stride length for people with 
Parkinson disease or multiple sclerosis and number of steps for people with 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or proximal femoral fracture. The 
consensus was not reached for any visualization reviewed in round 2 or 3. 
Feedback was generally positive, and some participants reported that they were 
able to understand the visualization and interpret what the visualization 
represented.
CONCLUSIONS: Through the feedback provided and existing data visualization 
principles, we developed recommendations for future visualizations of mobility- 
and health-related data. Visualizations should be readable by ensuring that 
large and clear fonts are used and should be friendly for people with vision 
impairments, such as color blindness. Patients have a strong understanding of 
their own condition and its variability; hence, adding additional factors into 
visualizations is recommended to better reflect the nuances of a condition. 
Ensuring that outcomes and visualizations are meaningful requires close 
collaboration with patients throughout the development process.

BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined the characteristics of the decline in 
physical activity levels in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients from the 
perspective of a 24-h behavioural profile, including sleep.
OBJECTIVE: To identify factors related to the rest and activity patterns in PD 
patients by assessing the Rest-Activity Rhythm.
METHODS: The participants were 20 patients with Parkinson's syndrome (PS group) 
and 20 healthy elderly community residents (control group). The nonparametric 
rest-activity rhythm parameters were measured by a wristwatch-type activity 
monitor worn by the study subjects on the non-dominant hand continuously for at 
least 5 days. To assess the specific symptoms of PS in the patients, the scores 
on the Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson's 
Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) were collected from the medical records.
RESULTS: In the PS group, a negative correlation was found between the relative 
amplitude and score for part I of the MDS-UPDRS, that is, non-motor symptoms 
(r = -0.51, p < 0.05). Additionally, binomial logistic regression analysis 
revealed two regression models, with Model I showing a significant association 
with the highest physical activity level over the 24-h profile (odds ratio, 
0.96; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.94-0.99; p = 0.002) and Model II 
showing a significant association with a fragmented rhythm (odds ratio, 1.04; 
95% CI, 1.01-1.07; p = 0.004).
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that rehabilitation of PD patients should 
include increasing their physical activity levels while minimising intermittency 
of the rest and activity patterns, and that attention should be paid to 
non-motor symptoms in addition to motor symptoms.

Fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs) are highly expressed in the 
central nervous system (CNS). It is demonstrated that the FHFs subfamily plays 
cardinal roles in several neuropathological diseases, while their involvement in 
Parkinson's disease (PD) has been so far scarcely investigated. From the 
publicly available Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets, FHF2 (also known as 
fibroblast growth factor 13, FGF13) alterations are described in PD patients. 
Fgf13 gene is significantly decreased in several PD mouse models, and its 
overexpression alleviates the PD-like pathological phenotype. Although FGF13 is 
highly expressed in neurons, it functions by preventing glia-dependent 
inflammatory processes. Mechanistically, FGF13 combines mitochondrial proteins 
such as MCHT2 (a protein localized on the mitochondrial outer membrane), to 
anchor mitochondria within the cytoplasm. Under PD-related stress, decreased 
neuronal FGF13 levels induce the release of the damaged mitochondria, which in 
turn activate microglia and astrocytes, thereby promoting neurodegeneration. 
Abacavir, an FDA-applied anti-retroviral drug, is identified to prevent 
excessive gliosis and neuron loss in both glia-neuron co-cultures and PD mouse 
models by rejuvenating FGF13 signaling. Collectively, neuronal FGF13 inhibits 
the transfer of stressed mitochondria to glia, thereby impeding 
neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Abacavir is a promising neuroprotectant 
and sets a brake to PD progression.

AIMS: Cotadutide is a dual glucagon-like peptide-1/glucagon receptor agonist. 
The objective of the analysis was to develop a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic 
(PK/PD) model to describe the relationship between cotadutide exposure and 
response on urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), urinary albumin (UALB), 
and body weight in participants with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) using data from a Phase2b study (NCT04515849).
METHODS: A total of 247 participants with CKD and T2DM were randomized and 
titrated to either 100, 300 or 600 μg cotadutide, 1 mg semaglutide or placebo. 
UACR was measured biweekly from either morning void (Weeks 14 and 26) or spot 
urine (other visits). The analysis was implemented using a longitudinal 
non-linear mixed-effect model. The potential impact of covariates on efficacy in 
participants was quantified.
RESULTS: PK/PD models were developed, and a significant relationship was 
identified between cotadutide exposure and PD biomarkers of UACR, UALB and body 
weight. The models described the data adequately; greater changes in PD 
responses were observed with higher cotadutide doses. Baseline mean blood 
pressure and baseline UALB were found to affect the reductions in UACR and UALB, 
respectively. Model-predicted relative change from placebo in UACR, UALB and 
body weight after 26 weeks of 600 μg cotadutide treatment were -45.6% (-52.4%, 
-38.7%), -47.2% (-56.0%, -39.9%) and -5.3% (-7.6%, -4.1%), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This modelling assessment was successfully applied for cotadutide 
to understand the relationship between cotadutide dosing regimen and the 
response in UACR, UALB and body weight. These models have general application in 
analysing and interpreting data from CKD/diabetic kidney disease (DKD) studies.

BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) results from complex interactions among 
environmental, genetic, and aging factors. Telomeres, which ensure chromosome 
stability, naturally shorten with cell division, contributing to aging and 
cellular senescence. However, studies investigating telomere length (TL) in PD 
have produced inconsistent results.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the relationship between TL and PD using a 
unique PD-discordant monozygotic twin design, which minimizes confounding 
factors such as age, gender, and genetic background. We also examined the impact 
of PD-related genetic mutations on TL.
METHODS: We analyzed relative telomere length (RTL) in blood samples from 29 
pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for PD. Data was stratified by disease 
duration, and we investigated the influence of genetic variants (GBA1 and LRRK2) 
on RTL.
RESULTS: No significant difference in RTL was observed between PD-affected twins 
and their healthy co-twins overall. However, twins with longer disease duration 
(≥8 years) showed a significant decline in RTL (0.90 ± 0.18 vs. 1.07 ± 0.24; 
P = 0.046), which was more pronounced with a 10-year disease duration cutoff 
(0.85 ± 0.18 vs. 1.06 ± 0.22; P = 0.015). GBA1-mutated PD twins exhibited 
significantly longer RTL than non-mutated twins, a result replicated in non-twin 
GBA1 carriers and extended to LRRK2 carriers.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that aging and cellular senescence primarily 
drive sporadic PD, whereas genetic forms are linked to disruptions in cellular 
pathways, such as lysosomal or mitochondrial functions. These insights highlight 
the role of genetics in telomere dynamics in PD. © 2025 The Author(s). Movement

BACKGROUND: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare neurodegenerative 
disorder characterized by parkinsonism and impairments in balance, language, and 
cognition. As an atypical parkinsonism, PSP progresses rapidly, lacks effective 
treatments, and poses significant caregiving burdens. While prior studies have 
identified risk factors, they often fail to capture the complex temporal 
dynamics of co-occurring conditions.
OBJECTIVES: To identify common PSP disease trajectories using a computational 
framework combining machine learning and network analysis.
METHODS: We analyzed ICD-10 codes from the University of California Health Data 
Warehouse to identify significant temporal risk factors and determine diagnostic 
trajectories. Multi-step trajectories were clustered using dynamic time warping 
and clustering. Network analysis identified common trajectory clusters, which 
were compared for patient demographics, symptoms, and PSP progression. Causal 
relationships were inferred through association tests and compared to control 
groups.
RESULTS: From an initial cohort of 1205 PSP patients, 247 with multi-step 
trajectories were included. The final dataset yielded 258 unique multi-step 
trajectories. A total of 258 unique trajectories were identified, grouped into 
three clusters: binocular movement disorder (N = 29), Parkinson's disease 
(N = 72), and other neurodegenerative diseases (N = 168). Demographics, 
symptoms, and disease progression differed significantly across clusters. Causal 
analysis revealed that 36.8% of trajectory connections were significant. 
Patients with multi-step risk factor trajectories exhibited higher PSP risk 
compared to those with single or no risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Distinct PSP trajectories were identified, offering insights into 
temporal and causal relationships. These findings can improve PSP risk 
assessment, early diagnosis, and personalized management, enhancing patient care 
and guiding future research.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and 
Parkinson's disease (PD) represent a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases 
(NDDs). Here, we performed the first direct comparison of their transcriptomic 
landscapes.
METHODS: We profiled whole transcriptomes of NDD cortical tissue by 
single-nucleus RNA sequencing, using computational analyses to identify common 
and distinct differentially expressed genes (DEGs), pathways, vulnerable and 
disease-driver cell subtypes, and altered cell-to-cell interactions.
RESULTS: The same inhibitory neuron subtype was depleted in both AD and DLB. 
Potentially disease-driving neuronal cell subtypes were identified in both PD 
and DLB. Cell-cell communication was predicted to be increased in AD but 
decreased in DLB and PD. DEGs were most commonly shared across NDDs within 
inhibitory neuron subtypes. Overall, AD and PD showed greatest transcriptomic 
divergence, while DLB exhibited an intermediate signature.
DISCUSSION: These results may help explain the clinicopathological spectrum of 
these NDDs and provide unique insights into shared and distinct molecular 
mechanisms underlying pathogenesis.
HIGHLIGHTS: The same vulnerable inhibitory neuron subtype population was 
depleted in both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). 
Potentially disease-driving neuronal cell subtypes were discovered in both 
Parkinson's disease (PD) and DLB. Cell-cell communication was predicted to be 
increased in AD but decreased in DLB and PD. Differentially expressed genes were 
most commonly shared across neurodegenerative diseases in inhibitory neuron 
types. AD and PD had the greatest transcriptomic divergence, with DLB showing an 
intermediate signature.

Melatonin, N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine, is a tryptophan-derived hormone mostly 
produced in the pineal gland, despite being synthesized locally at several 
tissues and organs. This production is rhythmically controlled by complex clock 
gene networks in the master pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of 
the hypothalamus. Melatonin is usually secreted only during the dark phase of 
the day and is essential to synchronize circadian rhythms and neuroendocrine 
physiological processes. Its main clinical use is associated with the treatment 
of jet lag and other circadian rhythm sleep disorders, with a growing number of 
other promising therapeutic applications due to the diverse physiological roles 
of melatonin. In this review, we explore melatonin and its receptors and provide 
an updated overview on research concerning the role of melatonin, either as an 
endogenous molecule or as a drug, in: sleep-wake cycle regulation; circadian 
rhythms; inflammatory processes that may compromise cardiovascular, respiratory, 
gastrointestinal, renal, and reproductive system functions; and 
neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The 
most recent and promising research findings concerning melatonin synthetic 
analogs such as agomelatine and ramelteon are highlighted, pointing toward new 
compounds with promising pharmacological activity while emphasizing their 
structural differences and advantages when compared to melatonin.

We report the first double-differential cross section measurement of 
neutral-current neutral pion (NCπ^{0}) production in neutrino-argon scattering, 
as well as single-differential measurements of the same channel in terms of 
final states with and without protons. The kinematic variables of interest for 
these measurements are the π^{0} momentum and the π^{0} scattering angle with 
respect to the neutrino beam. A total of 4971 candidate NCπ^{0} events fully 
contained within the MicroBooNE detector are selected using data collected at a 
mean neutrino energy of ∼0.8  GeV from 6.4×10^{20} protons on target from the 
Booster Neutrino Beam at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. After 
extensive data-driven model validation to ensure unbiased unfolding, the 
Wiener-singular-value-decomposition method is used to extract nominal 
flux-averaged cross sections. The results are compared to predictions from 
commonly used neutrino event generators, which tend to overpredict the measured 
NCπ^{0} cross section, especially in the 0.2-0.5  GeV/c π^{0} momentum range and 
at forward scattering angles. Events with at least one proton present in the 
final state are also underestimated. This data will help improve the modeling of 
NCπ^{0} production, which represents a major background in measurements of 
charge-parity violation in the neutrino sector and in searches for new physics 
beyond the standard model.

Loss-of-function mutations in the PINK1 kinase lead to early-onset Parkinson's 
disease (PD). PINK1 is activated by mitochondrial damage to phosphorylate 
ubiquitin and Parkin, triggering mitophagy. PINK1 also indirectly phosphorylates 
Rab GTPases, such as Rab8A. Using an siRNA library targeting human Ser/Thr 
kinases in HeLa cells, we identified EIF2AK1 [heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) 
kinase], a branch of the integrated stress response (ISR), as a negative 
regulator of PINK1. EIF2AK1 knockdown enhances mitochondrial 
depolarization-induced PINK1 stabilization and phosphorylation of ubiquitin and 
Rab8A. These results were confirmed in SK-OV-3, U2OS, and ARPE-19 cells. 
Knockdown of DELE1, an activator of EIF2AK1, produced similar effects. Notably, 
the ISR inhibitor ISRIB also enhanced PINK1 activation. In human cells with 
mito-QC mitophagy reporters, EIF2AK1 knockdown or ISRIB treatment increased 
PINK1-dependent mitophagy without affecting deferiprone-induced mitophagy. These 
findings suggest that the DELE1-EIF2AK1 ISR pathway is a negative regulator of 
PINK1-dependent mitophagy. Further evaluation in PD-relevant models is needed to 
assess the therapeutic potential of targeting this pathway.

Genome-wide analysis reveals genes mediating resistance to paraquat 
neurodegeneration in Drosophila.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is thought to develop through a complex interplay of 
genetic and environmental factors. Epidemiological studies have linked exposure 
to certain pesticides such as paraquat with elevated PD risk, although how a 
person's genetic makeup influences disease risk upon exposure remains unknown. 
Here, we used a genome-wide approach to uncover genes that play a role in 
resistance to paraquat-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration in Drosophila. We 
developed a paraquat exposure model displaying delayed-onset dopaminergic (DA) 
neurodegeneration to recapitulate this aspect of human disease. We reveal that 
genetic background is a strong determinant of paraquat-induced DA 
neurodegeneration susceptibility across a series of nearly 200 fly strains 
called the Drosophila genetic reference panel (DGRP). Through unbiased 
genome-wide analysis and follow-up validation, we identify two candidate 
paraquat resistance genes, luna and CG32264. In gene-level studies, decreased 
expression of luna or CG32264 is associated with paraquat-induced DA neuron loss 
while overexpression of either gene prevents neurodegeneration in vivo. The 
mammalian ortholog of CG32264 is Phactr2, which has previously been linked to 
human idiopathic PD risk in several populations. Hence, our results reveal genes 
regulating paraquat-induced DA neuron loss that intersect with human PD risk 
variants, supporting the potential relevance of our findings to PD and 
underscoring a role for gene-environment interactions in pesticide-related DA 
neurodegeneration.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) 
effectively treats some of the motor manifestations of Parkinson disease (PD). 
However, previous work suggests STN-DBS may lead to worsening of balance and 
gait in some people with PD. Physical therapy (PT) is often used to improve 
balance and gait in PD, but its safety, feasibility, and efficacy have not been 
tested in people with STN-DBS. The purpose of this study was to test the safety, 
feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of PT for improving gait and balance in 
persons with PD and STN-DBS.
METHODS: This randomized pilot study compared the effects of an 8-week PT 
intervention (n = 15) on balance and gait to a usual care control group (n = 14) 
among people with PD with STN-DBS. Individuals were evaluated in the on 
medication/on stimulation state as well as off medication/off stimulation state.
RESULTS: PT was safe as there were no serious adverse events during treatment. 
PT was feasible as the average percentage of session attendance was 93%. PT 
significantly improved balance as measured by the Balance Evaluation Systems 
Test (BESTest) in the on medication/on stimulation state but did not 
significantly improve gait. No significant differences between groups were found 
in the off medication/off stimulation state.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: PT was safe, feasible, and may improve balance for 
individuals with PD with STN-DBS. Further work is needed to understand how 
modifying the frequency and intensity of PT interventions may impact balance and 
gait in individuals with STN-DBS.

The increasing global population threatens food security, necessitating 
sustainable agricultural practices. Intensive farming has led to the excessive 
use of pesticides and fertilizers, contaminating soil and water sources and 
causing the impairment of the environment. Pesticide residues enter the food 
chain, posing serious health risks like neurotoxicity, genetic mutations, and 
diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes, etc. Conventional detection 
methods are costly, complex, time-consuming, unsuitable for onsite detection, 
and mostly not eco-friendly. Fluorescence-based nano-biosensors, particularly 
carbon quantum dots (CQDs), offer a promising alternative to detect pesticides 
and herbicides due to their high sensitivity, biocompatibility, low toxicity, 
and photostability. In addition to their sensory application, CQDs could be used 
as an alternative to conventional chemical fertilizers for crop production. 
CQD-based nanofertilizers improve nutrient absorption, boost plant growth, and 
increase resistance to environmental stressors. This review will highlight the 
key advancements in CQDs in terms of various synthetic techniques and their use 
as nanosensors and nanofertilizers.

New Diagnostic and Staging Framework Applied to Established PD in the BioFIND 
Cohort.

Russo MJ, Kang UJ.

The proposed Neuronal α-Synuclein Disease Integrated Staging System (NSD-ISS) 
was recently applied to early Parkinson's disease (PD) cohorts. We applied this 
research framework to the BioFIND study cohort, which includes more moderately 
advanced PD participants with clinically established PD. Disease durations 
within each ISS stage were highly variable. Cognitive and non-motor anchors had 
little weight in determining staging. The analysis highlights strengths and 
limitations of NSD-ISS to guide further refinement of an integrated staging 
system.

OBJECTIVES: This study was planned to elucidate the mechanism of the protective 
effect of adropin in an experimental rat model of Parkinson's Disease (PD).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three-month-old male Wistar rats were randomly divided 
into four groups: i) Control, ii) Sham, iii) PD, and iv) PD+Adropin. The 
performance tests were performed seven days after the 6-Hydroxydopamine 
hydrochloride (6-OHDA) injection into the striatum. The immunoreactivities for 
tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), G protein-coupled receptor 19 (GPR19), and vascular 
endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) were detected by 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the substantia nigra (SN). Dopamine levels were 
measured by mass spectrometry. Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and pGSK3β 
(Ser9) protein levels were evaluated by western blot analysis.
RESULTS: Our study demonstrated that motor performances were significantly 
improved by adropin treatment. Central adropin injection prevented the loss of 
nigral dopaminergic neurons and induced VEGFR2 expression but not GPR19 compared 
to the PD group. The ratio of p-GSK3β/GSK3β did not differ between groups. 
However, the level of dopamine in SN was increased with adropin injection in the 
PD+Adropin group.
CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal that adropin administration has a protective 
effect on nigral dopaminergic neurons and acts through the VEGFR2 signaling 
pathway.

Background: This study explores the burden of Parkinson's disease (PD) in 
Kazakhstan, the largest country in Central Asia, a region where data on 
neurological disorders are notably sparse. Methods: Utilizing data from 
Kazakhstan's Unified National Electronic Health System during 2014-2021, the 
study investigates the epidemiology, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and 
survival outcomes in a cohort of PD patients. The authors employed Cox 
proportional hazards regression models and Kaplan-Meier analysis, alongside 
sensitivity analyses, to assess the impact of demographic factors, hypertension, 
and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) on survival. Results: The study cohort 
included 10,125 patients, revealing a tenfold increase in PD prevalence during 
the study period. Mortality rates varied significantly, with the highest rates 
observed in the eldest age group (137.05 per 1000 person-years). PD contributed 
to a loss of 156.12 DALYs per 100,000 population, primarily driven by years of 
life lost. The analysis identified an increased risk of all-cause mortality 
among males (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.6; 1.5-1.8), older individuals (aHR 
1.05; 1.04-1.06), those with higher CCIs, and individuals of Kazakh ethnicity. 
Interestingly, patients with comorbid hypertension had a higher probability of 
survival (aHR 0.67; 0.60-0.73). Conclusion: This study is the first of its kind 
in Central Asia to examine the burden of PD using a large-scale outpatient 
registry. The findings underscore the need for targeted interventions to address 
the growing burden of PD, particularly among males and ethnic Kazakhs. 
Additionally, further research is needed to explore the inverse association 
between hypertension and survival in the PD cohort.

Levodopa is the most common therapy to reduce motor symptoms of parkinsonism. 
However, levodopa has potential to exacerbate cardiovascular autonomic (CVA) 
dysfunction that may co-occur in patients. Heart rate variability (HRV) is the 
most common method for assessing CVA function, but broader monitoring of CVA 
function and levodopa effects is typically limited to clinical settings and 
symptom reporting, which fail to capture its holistic nature. In this study, we 
evaluated the feasibility of a multimodal wearable chest patch for monitoring 
changes in CVA function during clinical and 24-h ambulatory (at home) conditions 
in 14 patients: 11 with Parkinson's disease (PD) and 3 with multiple system 
atrophy (MSA). In-clinic data were analyzed to examine the effects of orally 
administered levodopa on CVA function using a pre (OFF) and 60-min (ON) 
post-exposure protocol. Wearable-derived physiological markers related to the 
electrical and mechanical activity of the heart alongside vascular function were 
extracted. Pre-ejection period (PEP) and ratio of PEP to left ventricular 
ejection time index (LVETi) increased significantly (p  <  0.05) following 
levodopa, indicating a decrease in cardiac contractility. We further explored 
dose-response relationships and how CVA responses differed between participants 
with orthostatic hypotension (OH) from those without OH. Heart rate variability, 
specifically root-mean-square-of-successive-differences (RMSSD), following 
levodopa decreased significantly more in participants with OH (n = 7) compared 
to those without (no-OH, n = 7). The results suggest that the wearable patch's 
measures are sensitive to CVA dynamics and provide exploratory insights into 
levodopa's potential role in inducing a negative inotropic effect and 
exacerbating CVA dysfunction. This work encourages further evaluation of these 
wearable-derived physiomarkers for quantifying CVA and informing individualized 
care of individuals with parkinsonism.

Photobiomodulation (PBM) has emerged as a rapidly growing and innovative 
therapeutic method for various illnesses in recent years. Due to the 
irreversible nature of Parkinson's disease (PD), it has proven challenging to 
impede or postpone the progression of the disease. Despite research on 
pharmacological approaches to halt neuronal degeneration, the viability of these 
techniques has been called into doubt due to apprehensions over potential side 
effects and the ethical implications associated with the utilization of 
embryonic cell transplantation. Hence, developing an innovative therapeutic 
approach to halting neuronal degeneration and safeguarding neurons from this 
neurodegenerative disorder is imperative. This review examines the pathogenesis, 
challenges, and limitations of conventional PD therapies, allowing a closer 
examination of PBM's distinctive approach within this medical context. Delving 
into PBM's therapeutic mechanisms in the cells, the effects of different 
wavelengths on cell therapies in PD patients, and considerations for patient 
care administration to overcome traditional challenges, this study offers 
insights into its potential as a promising avenue for PD management.

INTRODUCTION: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder majorly 
associated with movement and behavioral disturbances. Pathologically, the loss 
of dopaminergic (DA) neurons triggered by the deposition of α-synuclein (SNCA) 
leads to the decrease in dopamine levels affecting motor and cognitive functions 
of the brain. Current pharmacotherapy for PD only addresses its symptoms but is 
not able to halt its progression. Traditional medicines are being increasingly 
used for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.
AIM: The present study investigated the effects of Neurogrit Gold (NG), a 
herbo-mineral prescription medicine, on a Parkinson's model of Caenorhabditis 
elegans.
METHODS: Chemical characterization of NG was performed on HPLC and GC-MS/MS 
platforms. Evaluation of NG was done in the neurotoxicant 6-OHDA-induced N2, 
BZ555, and NL5901 strains of C. elegans.
RESULTS: It was observed that NG treatment did not hamper the lifespan, 
survival, and progeny development of C. elegans strains. The worms treated with 
NG were able to resist the deleterious effects of 6-OHDA on survival, progeny 
development, body bends, and chemotaxis in N2 and DA neuron degeneration in 
BZ555 worms. In NL5901 worms, NG treatment reduced SNCA aggregation, restored 
lipid content, as well as improved body bends, chemotaxis, and food uptake. Gene 
expression studies on 6-OHDA exposed and NG-treated N2 worms suggest that the 
neuroprotective effects of NG stem from its ability to regulate genes involved 
in mitochondrial autophagy (pink-1, pdr-1); dopamine synthesis (cat-2); redox 
(sod-3) and protein folding homeostasis (hsf-1, hsp-12.3).
CONCLUSION: Neurogrit Gold has robust neuroprotective effects, making it a 
suitable treatment option against etiologies of Parkinson's disease.

INTRODUCTION: Freezing of gait (FOG) is a debilitating symptom in Parkinson's 
disease (PD) patients that severely impairs mobility. Rhythmic auditory 
stimulation (RAS) has demonstrated potential in improving gait, but the 
mechanisms underlying its efficacy remain unclear. This study explored the 
impact of RAS on brain function in PD patients with FOG using functional 
near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during an imagined walking task, with the aim 
of elucidating the underlying mechanisms involved.
METHODS: We enrolled 45 PD patients, comprising 21 with FOG (PD+FOG), 24 without 
FOG (PD-FOG), and 10 healthy controls (HC). Using a 53-channel fNIRS system, we 
measured the oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) content in brain regions as subjects 
performed an imagined walking task both with and without RAS. Dynamic functional 
connectivity and k-means clustering were employed to identify key brain 
connectivity states. Data processing was conducted using MATLAB R2014a, with 
one-way ANOVA to select channels of interest, followed by paired t-tests for 
comparative analysis.
RESULTS: PD+FOG patients showed significantly lower activation in the 
supplementary motor area (SMA) and the left primary motor cortex of the lower 
limb (M1-LL) without RAS compared to PD-FOG patients and HC. RAS significantly 
increased activation in these areas and altered functional connectivity, 
characterized by an increased frequency of transitions between low-strength and 
medium-strength connectivity states in PD+FOG patients.
CONCLUSION: RAS may ameliorate gait in FOG patients by activating key motor 
areas (SMA and left M1-LL) and modulating the dynamic regulation of brain 
connectivity. This research provides valuable insights into the neural processes 
involved in the therapeutic effects of RAS.

The motor stage of Parkinson's disease (PD) can be preceded for years by a 
prodromal stage characterized by non-motor symptoms like REM sleep behavior 
disorder (RBD), hyposmia, and constipation. Here, we show that multiple stages 
of idiopathic PD, including the pre-motor prodromal stage, can be stratified 
according to the inflammatory responses to stimulation of peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells ex vivo. IFNγ stimulation of isolated monocytes reveals 
increased stimulation-dependent secretion of TNF, IL-1β, and IL-8 in prodromal 
PD relative to moderate stage PD. Additionally, T cells stimulated with CD3/CD28 
co-stimulatory beads show diminished proinflammatory cytokine secretion in 
early-moderate PD relative to prodromal. Receiver operating characteristic 
curves demonstrate that several cytokines produced by stimulated monocytes show 
high predictive utility for distinguishing prodromal PD individuals from 
neurologically healthy controls. Moreover, immune stimulation reveals deficits 
in CD8+ T-cell mitochondrial health in moderate PD, with relative mitochondrial 
health in CD8+ T cells being positively correlated with stimulation-dependent 
secretion of IL-1β, IL-8, and IL-10 in T cells from prodromal PD subjects. 
Dysregulated mitochondrial health in immune cells may contribute to peripheral 
inflammation and PD progression, and ex vivo stimulation-based assays have the 
potential to reveal novel biomarkers for patient stratification and progression 
with immune endophenotypes.

α-Synuclein (αSyn) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of 
'Synucleinopathies'. Although increased nuclear αSyn localization induces 
neurotoxicity, its definitive physiological role remains elusive. Previous 
studies on nuclear αSyn are limited to its interactions with individual histones 
and dsDNA, leaving a significant gap in understanding its interactions with 
assembled histone H2a-H2b dimer and (H3-H4)2 tetramer, as well as its role in 
chromatin regulation. Here, we demonstrate that αSyn binds specifically to both 
H2a-H2b and (H3-H4)2 with high affinity. Truncation studies reveal that 
αSyn(1-103) region interacts with (H3-H4)2, while the acidic (121-140) 
C-terminal end is crucial for H2a-H2b binding and contains a conserved DEF/YxP 
motif present in other dimer-binding histone chaperones. High-resolution 
structure of αSyn(121-140) with H2a-H2b complex reveals that αSyn adopts two 
binding modes (BM-1 and BM-2). Nonetheless, the αSyn C-terminal end in both 
modes overlap but runs in opposite orientations, specifically interacting with 
the H2a-L2 and H2b-L1 loop regions of the dimer and cap the H2a-R78 residue. 
Mutational analysis confirms that αSyn-Y136 and P138 residues, part of the 
DEF/YxP motif, together with H2a-R78, are critical for αSyn-(H2a-H2b) 
interaction. The chaperoning assay supports αSyn's function as a histone 
chaperone, suggesting the potential role of αSyn in the nucleosome 
assembly/disassembly process.

Neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's (PD) and Alzheimer's (AD) exhibit 
considerable heterogeneity of functional brain features within patients, 
complicating diagnosis and treatment. Here, we use electroencephalography (EEG) 
and normative modeling to investigate neurophysiological mechanisms underpinning 
this heterogeneity. Resting-state EEG data from 14 clinical units included 
healthy adults (n = 499) and patients with PD (n = 237) and AD (n = 197), aged 
over 40. Spectral and source connectivity analyses provided features for 
normative modeling, revealing significant, frequency-dependent EEG deviations 
with high heterogeneity in PD and AD. Around 30% of patients exhibited spectral 
deviations, while ~80% showed functional source connectivity deviations. 
Notably, the spatial overlap of deviant features did not exceed 60% for spectral 
and 25% for connectivity analysis. Furthermore, patient-specific deviations 
correlated with clinical measures, with greater deviations linked to worse UPDRS 
for PD (⍴ = 0.24, p = 0.025) and MMSE for AD (⍴ = -0.26, p = 0.01). These 
results suggest that EEG deviations could enrich individualized clinical 
assessment in Precision Neurology.

BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) technology has emerged as a promising tool for 
cognitive rehabilitation in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. These 
patients often endure significant cognitive impairments, which are associated 
with decreased quality of life and increased disease burden. Traditional 
treatments are limited in improving cognitive functions, making VR-based 
interventions an area of growing interest.
OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the efficacy of VR-based 
interventions on cognitive function in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders 
by synthesizing data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive search across 
PubMed, Web of Science, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library for RCTs from 
January 2010 to December 2024. Studies were included if they evaluated the 
impact of VR-based interventions on cognitive outcomes in patients with 
neuropsychiatric disorders. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were 
performed independently by 2 researchers. Meta-analyses were conducted using 
random-effects models, and standardized mean differences (SMDs) as effect size.
RESULTS: A total of 21 RCTs involving 1051 participants were included. Overall, 
VR-based interventions significantly improved cognitive functions of patients 
with neuropsychiatric disorders (SMD 0.67, 95% CI 0.33-1.01, z=3.85; P<.001). 
Subgroup analyses revealed significant benefits for cognitive rehabilitation 
training (SMD 0.75, 95% CI 0.33-1.17, z=3.53; P<.001), exergame-based training 
(SMD 1.09, 95% CI 0.26-1.91, z=2.57; P=.01), and telerehabilitation and social 
functioning training (SMD 2.21, 95% CI 1.11-3.32, z=3.92; P<.001). Conversely, 
immersive cognitive training, music attention training, and vocational and 
problem-solving skills training did not yield significant improvements (z=1.86, 
P=.06; z=0.35, P=.72; z=0.88, P=.38; respectively). Disease-type subgroup 
analyses indicated significant improvements in schizophrenia (SMD 0.92, 95% CI 
0.22-1.62, z=2.58; P=.01), and mild cognitive impairment (SMD 0.75, 95% CI 
0.16-1.35, z=2.47; P=.01), but not in brain injuries, Parkinson disease, or 
stroke (z=0.34, P=.73; z=1.26, P=.21; z=1.16, P=.24; respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis revealed that VR-based interventions can improve 
cognitive functions among individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders, with 
notable improvements observed in cognitive rehabilitation training, 
exergame-based training, and tele-rehabilitation and social functioning 
training. These results offer valuable evidence supporting the use of VR 
technology in rehabilitation for neuropsychiatric conditions and inform the 
optimization of future intervention approaches.

BACKGROUND: Persons with chronic stroke (PwCS) exhibit impaired paretic 
propulsion generation. Consequently, PwCS walk slower than healthy peers and 
rely more on their non-paretic leg, leading to propulsion asymmetry. However, it 
remains unclear how propulsion symmetry is influenced by walking at various gait 
speeds. This study aimed to investigate the relation between gait speed and 
propulsion symmetry in PwCS and controls.
METHODS: Fifteen PwCS and sixteen healthy controls walked on an instrumented 
treadmill at randomized speeds, ranging from 0.2 m/s to comfortable walking 
speeds for PwCS or 0.4 to 1.6 m/s for controls, with 0.2 m/s increments. PwCS 
continued to their maximum speed with 0.1 m/s increments. Propulsion, derived 
from the anteroposterior component of the ground reaction force, was defined as 
propulsion peak and propulsion impulse. The primary outcome was propulsion peak 
and impulse symmetry (paretic propulsion / total propulsion), with secondary 
outcomes being propulsion peak and impulse per leg. The relationship between 
gait speed and propulsion metrics was analyzed using linear mixed models (LMM).
RESULTS: PwCS exhibited clear propulsion peak and impulse asymmetry across all 
gait speeds, while controls maintained symmetrical propulsion. LMMs revealed no 
change in propulsion peak symmetry with gait speed (β = 0.12, SE = 0.090, 
p = 0.19), with considerable variability among PwCS. Propulsion impulse symmetry 
improved with increasing gait speed (β = 0.39, SE = 0.048, p < 0.001), 
especially in PwCS who had greater asymmetry at comfortable walking speed. 
Propulsion peak and impulse increased with gait speed in both legs for PwCS and 
controls. The propulsion peak increase was stronger in the non-paretic compared 
to the paretic leg (0.16 ± 0.043 vs. 0.12 ± 0.042 N/kg per 0.1 m/s), while the 
propulsion impulse increase was similar between legs.
CONCLUSIONS: PwCS showed reduced paretic leg contribution to forward propulsion 
across various gait speeds. The relative paretic contribution for propulsion 
peak remained constant while it increased with gait speed for propulsion 
impulse, especially in those with greater asymmetry at their comfortable walking 
speed. Furthermore, all participants were able to increase paretic propulsion 
peak and impulse above their propulsion at comfortable walking speed, suggesting 
some residual paretic capacity.

BACKGROUND: In the last twenty years, epidemiological research has suggested a 
potential decreased susceptibility to cancer among individuals diagnosed with 
Parkinson's disease (PD), although conflicting findings exist regarding the 
connection between PD and Colorectal cancer (CRC). This systematic review and 
meta-analysis were conducted to investigate the contemporary epidemiological 
data on the risk of CRC in PD.
METHODS: A comprehensive search of the literature was conducted utilizing three 
databases: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. We included observational studies 
(cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort) that examined the relationship 
between PD and CRC. We also analyzed data obtained from the Parkinson's 
Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) to evaluate the frequency of CRC among 
individuals diagnosed with PD, control participants, and PD patients carrying 
the LRRK2 genetic variant.
RESULTS: We included 22 studies with a total of 1,3137,089 PD cases were 
included in our study. Our analysis demonstrated a significant relationship 
between PD and a reduced incidence of CRC (pooled RR = 0.80, 95% 
CI = 0.69-0.91). Subgroup analysis based on study design revealed a significant 
association in the cohort (pooled RR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.66-0.93) and 
case-control studies (pooled RR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.66-0.89). Also, sub-group 
analysis based on the study continent showed no significant association in North 
America (pooled RR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.51-1.18, and Asia (pooled RR = 0.85, 95% 
CI = 0.55-1.15). However, analysis based on continents indicated significant 
results solely in Europe (pooled RR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.71-0.86). PPMI analysis 
revealed distinct differences in CRC frequencies across the three groups 
(p < 0.001) with PD patients with LRRK2 genetic variant exhibited the highest 
frequency of colorectal cancer, followed closely by healthy subjects.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our study demonstrates a decreased risk of CRC in 
individuals with PD, suggesting an inverse association between the two diseases. 
Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving 
this correlation, paving the way for the development of targeted strategies for 
the prevention and management of both PD and CRC.

Emodin, a naturally occurring compound derived from anthraquinone, demonstrates 
notable efficacy in combating oxidative stress, protecting neural tissues, and 
inhibiting malignant cell proliferation. This bioactive phytochemical has 
garnered significant scientific attention due to its multifaceted therapeutic 
potential, particularly in the context of oncological interventions and 
neurodegenerative disorder management. The neuroprotective capacity of emodin in 
preventing dopaminergic neuronal demise through ferroptosis modulation requires 
further exploration. Our experimental approach employed Erastin and 
MPP+-activated cellular systems to systematically evaluate this anthraquinone's 
therapeutic potential in counteracting iron-dependent programmed cell death 
mechanisms. Experimental data revealed that emodin effectively suppressed 
iron-dependent cell death through upregulation of mitochondrial complex III 
component UQCRC1. In MPP+-challenged Parkinsonian models, this compound 
substantially reduced degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons. Mechanistic 
investigations demonstrated that ferroptotic pathway activation contributes to 
MPP+-mediated neurotoxicity, while emodin counteracts this process via 
UQCRC1-mediated cytoprotection. These findings establish a novel regulatory axis 
linking UQCRC1 activation with ferroptosis inhibition, proposing emodin as a 
dual-function agent capable of both attenuating neuronal demise and modulating 
programmed cell death pathways. The pharmacological profile of emodin suggests 
clinical potential for intervening in ferroptosis-associated neurodegeneration.

Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) with probable rapid eye movement sleep 
behavior disorder (RBD) (PD-RBD), a specific subtype of PD, are characterized by 
the presence of more severe motor and non-motor symptoms. This study aimed to 
elucidate the characteristics and interactions of gut microbiota and plasma 
metabolic characteristics of PD-RBD, thus screening for the disease mechanisms. 
A total of 100 PD patients, 50 healthy controls (HCs) and 16 probable idiopathic 
RBD (iRBD) patients were collected. There were 33 PD-RBD and 67 patients without 
probable RBD (PD-nRBD) in PD patients. DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and 
high-throughput sequencing were used for intestinal microbiota analysis, and 
ultra-high liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was used for 
metabolome analysis. Spearman analysis was applied to investigate the 
correlation of fecal microbiota and plasma metabolome. Our findings revealed 
Lactobacillaceae (P = 0.017), Christensenellaceae (P = 0.017), Fusobacteriaceae 
(P = 0.018), Lactobacillus (P = 0.035), Christensenellaceae R-7 group (P = 
0.035), and Fusobacterium (P = 0.035) were significantly different in PD-RBD, 
PD-nRBD, and HC. Moreover, the differential metabolites identified in both 
PD-nRBD and PD-RBD were 3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridine-4,5-dicarboxylate (VIP = 
5.802) and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol sulfate (VIP = 5.732). Furthermore, 
our analysis revealed that 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol sulfate showed a 
positive correlation with Lactobacillus (r = 0.197, P = 0.049). Finally, 
functional analysis indicated that these distinctive microbiota and metabolites 
were primarily associated with phenylalanine metabolism and vitamin B6 
metabolism. We managed to show that the differential microbiota, differential 
metabolites, and their interactions in PD-RBD compared to PD-nRBD and HC. This 
furthers our understanding of disease pathogenesis, and offers fresh 
perspectives on its detection and treatment.
IMPORTANCE: There are currently fewer investigations on the intestinal 
microbiota and metabolites of probable rapid eye movement sleep behavior 
disorder (PD-RBD) and idiopathic RBD (iRBD). Our findings indicate that PD-RBD 
exhibits an increase in Christensenellaceae and 
3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol sulfate, and that iRBD exhibits a similar 
trend. This suggests that the PD prodromal stage may have seen this alteration. 
Furthermore, functional analysis indicated that these distinctive microbiota and 
metabolites were primarily associated with phenylalanine metabolism and vitamin 
B6 metabolism. Basic experiments and multi-center, large-cohort clinical 
researches are worth conducting to confirm this, since they may offer insights 
for treating individuals with PD-RBD.

A significant barrier to the treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) is 
a limited understanding of disease mechanisms. Heterozygous missense variants in 
PPP2R5D cause Houge-Janssens syndrome 1, a rare NDD characterized by 
macrocephaly, developmental delay, intellectual disability, seizures, autism 
spectrum disorder, and early onset Parkinson's disease. This study investigated 
the impact of pathogenic PPP2R5D variants on neuronal development and evaluated 
allele-specific knockdown as a potential therapeutic strategy. Induced 
pluripotent stem cells derived from individuals carrying the E198K and E420K 
variants, along with CRISPR-corrected isogenic controls, were differentiated 
into neural progenitors and cortical glutamatergic neurons. Patient-derived 
neural progenitors were hyper-proliferative, and glutamatergic neurons 
differentiated from these cells exhibited increased neurite outgrowth. Notably, 
neuronal overgrowth phenotypes were not observed in neurons lacking PPP2R5D, 
suggesting the disorder does not result from loss of function. RNA-seq of 
glutamatergic neurons derived from patient lines compared to their isogenic 
controls revealed disruptions in pathways critical for neuronal development, 
synaptic signaling, and axon guidance. To target pathogenic transcripts, 
antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) were designed to selectively knockdown the 
E198K allele, the most common disease-causing missense variant. The most 
effective ASOs reversed neurite outgrowth defects in patient-derived neurons. 
These findings uncover molecular mechanisms underlying PPP2R5D-related NDD and 
support allele-specific knockdown as a potential therapeutic approach.

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
pathologically characterized by the presence of neuronal intracytoplasmic 
inclusions known as Lewy bodies. Core clinical features include fluctuating 
cognitive impairment, recurrent visual hallucinations, REM sleep behavior 
disorder, and Parkinsonism. Cholinergic dysfunction is implicated in many of the 
symptoms of DLB, based on both pathologic and functional imaging studies, as 
well as the clear symptomatic response of cognitive and behavioral symptoms to 
drugs that modulate the cholinergic system. In this chapter, we will review and 
discuss the evidence for cholinergic dysfunction in DLB and its clinical and 
therapeutic implications.

Acetylcholine (ACh) is a leading regulatory neurotransmitter in the nervous 
system, which functions both directly and as modulator of other 
neurotransmitters. It is found in the central and peripheral nervous system, as 
well as in the autonomic system-both sympathetic and parasympathetic. In the 
central nervous system (CNS), ACh functions not only as a neurotransmitter, but 
also as a modulator of cognitive functions, including long-term and short-term 
memory, limbic activation, and alertness. No process in the mammalian body can 
commence without its participation.

In Parkinson disease (PD), cholinergic dysfunction develops in the early stages 
of the neurodegenerative process and progresses over time. Basal forebrain 
cholinergic system dysfunction is historically linked to cognitive decline in 
the dementia spectrum, and its pathophysiologic role in PD-related cognitive 
impairment has now been well established. However, cholinergic system 
dysfunction is also linked to several other manifestations of PD, such as gait 
difficulties, REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), neuropsychiatric manifestations 
such as depression and visual hallucinations, and olfactory dysfunction. 
Furthermore, disruption of the striatal intrinsic cholinergic system, which 
modulates dopamine release, has been linked to cardinal motor manifestations and 
dyskinesia. Manifestations of cognitive decline, gait problems, falls, and RBD 
tend to cluster in a subset of people with PD, so that a "cholinergic phenotype" 
has been proposed. In this chapter, the involvement of the cholinergic system 
and its clinical correlates in PD will be discussed.

This review explores the main aspects that form the basis of the 
cholinergic-oriented treatment of Alzheimer disease. Muscarinic acetylcholine 
receptor subtypes in the brain and periphery are discussed. It includes a new 
and updated overview of the involvement of muscarinic receptors in Alzheimer 
disease and the recent development of new and highly selective M1 muscarinic 
receptor agonists with disease-modifying potential. Activation of the M1 
muscarinic receptor is a rational therapeutic strategy for the treatment of 
schizophrenia and Alzheimer disease, as this receptor plays a pivotal role in 
modulating cognitive deficits and the pathology of the disease. Such activation 
can be achieved through M1 allosteric and bitopic muscarinic agonists, M1 
positive allosteric modulators (M1 PAMs), and direct-acting M1 muscarinic 
orthosteric agonists. The efficacy of M1 PAMs depends on acetylcholine, which 
declines in Alzheimer disease as postsynaptic neurons lose cholinergic input 
from the basal forebrain. On the other hand, the activity of M1 muscarinic 
orthosteric agonists is independent of the functional or anatomic integrity of 
presynaptic cholinergic terminals, and likely retain efficacy as the disease 
progresses, even after presynaptic degeneration of cholinergic fibers. Based on 
the acceptance criteria for a preferred M1 muscarinic agonist for the treatment 
of AD, aiming for efficacy, specificity, and safety in clinical use, few M1 
muscarinic agonists fulfill these requirements, such as orthosteric M1 
agonists-cevimeline (aka AF102B), the first FDA-approved M1 agonist, and NSC001 
(aka AF267B). The pros and cons of various muscarinic agonists developed are 
critically discussed in comparison to these drugs. The review proposes new 
alternatives to cholinergic therapy, particularly selective M1 muscarinic drugs, 
that should be designed to amplify its clinical effect and supplement the 
disease-modifying effect of new treatments to slow down or arrest disease 
progression.

This chapter describes how the clinical efficacy of orally administered 
cholinesterase inhibitors has been demonstrated through placebo-controlled 
randomized clinical trials leading to regulatory approval worldwide for the 
symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer disease. Over time, other clinical 
indications have been found, such as Dementia with Lewy Bodies and Parkinson 
disease Dementia. The route of administration includes transdermal patches. Side 
effects predominantly arise from peripheral parasympathetic stimulation. There 
is hope that drugs acting on acetylcholine release or on muscarinic receptors 
can exert additional symptomatic benefits.

The endocannabinoid system (eCBs) modulates corticostriatal circuits through 
cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R). These circuits are crucial for encoding 
goal-directed and habitual learning behaviors and are implicated in the 
occurrence and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). While exercise has been 
shown to enhance motor performance and reverse learning deficits in PD patients, 
the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that a 
treadmill training program could rescue changes in striatal plasticity and 
ameliorate early motor and cognitive deficits in mice subjected to an 
intrastriatal 6-hydroxydopamine injection. Our findings demonstrated that 
exercise training would improve motor performance and learning abilities in PD 
mice. Moreover, both immunofluorescence and reverse transcription polymerase 
chain reaction results suggested that corticostriatal activation decreased CB1R 
expression in the dorsomedial striatum of PD mice but increased expression in 
the substantia nigra pars reticulata following treadmill exercise. These results 
suggest that dysregulated CB1R expression is associated with the pathogenesis of 
Parkinsonism, highlighting the vital role of the CB1R in corticostriatal pathway 
functionality enhanced by exercise. Our results suggest the potential benefits 
of treadmill exercise in alleviating Parkinsonism, providing valuable insights 
into future potential treating strategies.

Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease 
(PD), and Huntington's disease (HD) are characterized by progressive neuronal 
damage, protein aggregation, and chronic inflammation, leading to cognitive and 
motor impairments. Despite symptomatic relief from current therapies, 
disease-modifying treatments targeting the core molecular mechanism are still 
lacking. RNA-based therapies offer a promising approach to treating 
neurodegenerative disease by targeting molecular mechanisms such as gene 
expression, protein synthesis, and neuroinflammation. Therapeutic strategies 
include Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), RNA 
interference (RNAi), small interfering RNA (siRNA) and short hairpin RNA 
(shRNA), messenger RNA (mRNA) therapies, and microRNA (miRNA)-based 
interventions. These therapies aim to decrease toxic protein accumulation, 
restore deficient proteins, and modulate inflammatory responses in conditions 
like AD, PD, and HD. Unlike conventional treatments that primarily manage 
symptoms, RNA-based therapies have the potential to modify disease progression 
by addressing its root causes. This review aims to provide a comprehensive 
overview of current RNA-based therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative 
diseases, discussing their mechanism of action, preclinical and clinical 
advancement. It further explores innovative solutions, including 
nanocarrier-mediated delivery, chemical modifications to enhance RNA stability, 
and personalized medicine approaches guided by genetic profiling that are being 
developed to overcome these barriers. This review also underscores the 
therapeutic opportunities and current limitations of RNA-based interventions, 
highlighting their potential to transform the future of neurodegenerative 
disease management.

Parkinson's disease (PD) has become a global health threat as a progressive 
neurodegenerative disorder. Polygonatum cyrtonema polysaccharide (PCP), the main 
bioactive constituent in P. cyrtonema rhizome, displays various biological 
activities. However, its antiparkinsonian effect is elusive. Here, the effect of 
PCP on PD-like pathology was evaluated in 
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model and 
its molecular mechanism was further investigated. The results showed that PCP at 
different dosages significantly improved MPTP-induced weight loss and dyskinesia 
in PD mice. Moreover, PCP treatment mitigated the dopaminergic neuron loss in 
the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Analysis of apoptosis-related proteins 
revealed that PCP markedly decreased the expression levels of Bax and 
cleaved-caspase 3, and increased the expression level of Bcl-2 in PD mice. 
Meanwhile, PCP markedly enhanced the activities of antioxidant enzymes 
superoxidase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and catalase (CAT), reduced 
malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and reversed the expression of oxidant 
stress-related proteins Nrf2 and Keap1, in the SNc of PD mice. Furthermore, PCP 
treatment significantly reduced the MPTP-mediated increase of endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER) stress-related proteins. These findings suggest that PCP protects 
against PD-like pathology by mitigating oxidant stress and ER stress-mediated 
apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic 
agent for PD.

BACKGROUND: While Parkinson's disease is a low dopamine neurodegenerative 
disorder, Schizophrenia is considered a high dopamine psychiatric disorder. 
Pharmacological interventions that are directed to normalize dopamine 
concentrations in the mid-brain for an extended duration lead to unintended 
consequences. Parkinson's disease patients experience psychosis, and 
Schizophrenia patients develop extra-pyramidal symptoms due to dopamine levels 
overshooting their physiological range. An objective monitoring technique is 
therefore required for better therapeutic efficacy in these two neurological 
diseases.
METHODS: A rapid and sensitive assay for α-Synuclein based on magnetic 
enrichment and enzymatic fluorescent signal generation was developed. This assay 
has been benchmarked with conventional ELISA and validated in 53 CSF and 36 
serum samples.
RESULTS: Developed assay from an experimental perspective has a sensitivity of 
less than 10 pg/mL; requires a turnaround time of 45 mins; and uses 2 µL of 
CSF/serum fluid samples to quantify alpha synuclein. From a utility perspective, 
the assay showed (a) a two-fold linearity across clinical phenotypes of 
Parkinson's disease, neurological controls, and schizophrenia patients; (b) 
variation between the naïve and treated patients; (c) correlation with severity 
of the disease. From a diagnostic perspective, the serum-based assay had a 100 % 
specificity and a minimum of 67 % sensitivity in differentiating naïve patients 
from treated patients; the CSF/serum-based assays had a minimum of 91 % 
specificity and a minimum of 85 % sensitivity in differentiating patients from 
neurological controls.
CONCLUSIONS: The developed assay can be used to quantify alpha-synuclein in 
serum and CSF samples, thereby setting a translational platform for diagnosis, 
prognosis, and monitoring pharmacotherapy patients with Parkinson's disease and 
Schizophrenia.

The single-step biotransformation of the natural compound piperine into a known 
dual inhibitor of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) and catechol-O-methyltransferase 
(COMT), was achieved by cytochrome P450 BM3 wild-type and the D251G/Q307H double 
mutant. This compound is used for research in neurodegenerative disorders, such 
as Parkinson's disease, and its value in the market is ∼14,000 €/g. Currently, 
it is produced by chemical synthesis requiring incubation of piperine with boron 
tribromide (BBr3) in dichloromethane with yield of product not exceeding 55 % 
and using tedious and long procedure for its production and isolation. The P450 
D251G/Q307H double mutant exhibited a 3-fold increase in catalytic efficiency 
compared to the wild-type enzyme, achieving high conversion (51.6 % of 
conversion in 15 minutes) under mild, environmentally friendly conditions. The 
yield of production was 0.01 mg of the inhibitor in 1 mL of reaction in 
15 minutes at 28°C using the purified enzyme. Moreover, biological assays 
demonstrated that the resulting compound has a novel and stronger antioxidant 
and antimicrobial activities, respectively, when compared to piperine. The data 
further demonstrates the broader potential of engineered enzymes as versatile 
and sustainable tools in industrial biotechnology, offering an efficient 
platform for the modification of natural compounds to produce bioactive 
molecules.

Chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI), is a well-recognized 
phenomenon in cancer patients who have undergone chemotherapy but the exact 
molecular mechanisms underpinning CRCI remain elusive. Symptoms reported by 
people with CRCI resemble those experienced by people with age-related 
neurodegenerative disorders (ARNDDs), yet no clear connection between CRCI and 
ARNDDs has been reported to date. The existence of shared mechanisms between 
these conditions offers opportunities for repurposing drugs already approved for 
the treatment of ARNDDs to improve symptoms of CRCI. Given that there is no 
available microarray or RNA-Seq data from the brains of people who have 
experienced CRCI, we investigated to what extent brain gene expression 
perturbations from validated rodent models of CRCI induced by chemotherapy 
compared with validated rodent models of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's 
disease. We utilized multiple bioinformatic analyses, including functional 
enrichment, protein-protein interaction network analyses, gene ontology analyses 
and identification of hub genes to reveal connections between comparable gene 
expression perturbations observed in these conditions. Collectively 165 genes 
overlapped between CRCI and Parkinson's disease and/or Alzheimer's disease, and 
15 overlapped between all three conditions. The joint genes between Alzheimer's 
disease, Parkinson's disease and CRCI demonstrate an average of 83.65% 
nucleotide sequence similarity to human orthologues. Gene ontology and pathway 
enrichment analyses suggest mechanisms involved in neural activity and 
inflammatory response as the key components of the studied neuropathological 
conditions. Accordingly, genes in which expression was comparably affected in 
all three condition models could be attributed to neuroinflammation, cell cycle 
arrest, and changes in physiological neural activity.

The accumulation of alpha-synuclein (⍺-Syn) fibrils plays a central role in the 
progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) and related neurodegenerative disorders. 
In this context, the development of peptide inhibitors designed to inhibit ⍺-Syn 
through computational methods has emerged as a promising area of research. This 
study focused on developing a peptide inhibitor, PQK7, designed based on the key 
residues of NAC region of ⍺-Syn fibrils involved in its aggregation. Using 
molecular docking and dynamics simulations, PQK7 was shown to bind key residues 
in the NAC region of ⍺-Syn (Val-74, Ala-76, Val-77, Thr-81, Ser-87, Ile-88, and 
Ala-89), effectively disrupting the formation of fibrils. MD simulations 
indicated that the PQK7-⍺-Syn complex reaches a stable conformation, which 
showed increased fluctuations and reduced β-sheet content, suggests that PQK7 
interferes with ⍺-Syn fibrillation at the molecular level. In vitro assays like 
ThT fluorescence assay, AFM imaging, CD specotroscopy, and SDS-PAGE analysis 
confirmed that PQK7 significantly reduces ⍺-Syn fibril formation, particularly 
at substoichiometric concentrations, while keeping ⍺-Syn monomers in a soluble 
state. Additionally, PQK7-⍺-Syn treatment in SH-SY5Y cells reduced the toxicity 
of ⍺-Syn aggregates, restoring normal cell cycle progression and reducing 
apoptosis and oxidative stress. Our findings suggest that PQK7 holds potential 
as a therapeutic agent for PD, acting as an anti-oligomeric inhibitor that 
targets early ⍺-Syn aggregates without affecting the protein's normal function.

BACKGROUND: Individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) commonly experience 
postural instability during walking and obstacle crossing. Previous research has 
explored virtual reality (VR) as a rehabilitation tool that affects gait.
RESEARCH QUESTION: How does a virtual reality environment influence the kinetic 
characteristics of gait during obstacle crossing in individuals with Parkinson's 
disease compared to real-world conditions?
METHODS: The study included 15 individuals with PD and 17 matched healthy 
control participants. The moment and power of lower extremity joints during 
walking and obstacle crossing conditions in real and VR environments were 
measured using three-dimensional motion analysis and force platforms.
RESULTS: The results indicate that individuals with PD demonstrated higher hip 
extensor moments during normal gait (NG) and obstacle crossing (OBS) tasks, 
accompanied by lower hip flexor moments compared to the control group. Moreover, 
PD individuals exhibited increased internal rotation hip joint moments during VR 
obstacle crossing (VR-OBS) tasks compared to NG.
CONCLUSION: Walking in a VR environment altered the kinetic status in both 
groups, potentially due to cautious walking to maintain stability. The greatest 
difference between the two groups was observed in the magnitude of joint moment 
in the sagittal plane, likely influenced by differences in walking speed. These 
findings underscore the unique joint moment patterns exhibited by PD patients 
during various tasks. Walking in a VR environment impacts the kinetic parameters 
of gait, which may have implications for designing rehabilitation programs aimed 
at improving gait stability in PD individuals. Clinically, these kinetic 
alterations highlight VR's potential as a safe modality for gait rehabilitation 
and fall prevention in PD.

INTRODUCTION: Heterozygous variants in the GBA1 gene encoding the 
glucocerebrosidase enzyme (GCase) are the most frequent genetic risk factor for 
Parkinson's Disease (PD). Yet, only a minority of GBA1 carriers will eventually 
develop overt PD, and the mechanisms underlying such reduced penetrance are 
still largely unexplored. Decreased GCase and increased α-synuclein levels are 
individually considered promising prognostic blood biomarkers for GBA-PD. Here, 
we aim to assess the combined role of decreased GCase activity and increased 
α-synuclein levels as a potential biochemical signature of worse outcome in GBA1 
population.
METHODS: Ninety-eight subjects (30 GBA-nonPD, 29 GBA-PD and 39 healthy controls) 
underwent a detailed clinical assessment, as well as measurement of GCase 
activity and total α-synuclein levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMCs). ROC curve analysis and a two-step clustering analysis were performed to 
classify subjects based on their combined GCase and α-synuclein biochemical 
profile. Clinical scores were analysed across clusters.
RESULTS: ROC curve analysis based on α-synuclein/GCase activity ratio was able 
to discriminate GBA1 positive individuals from healthy controls. We identified 
two separate biochemical clusters - a benign (high GCase/mid-low α-synuclein) 
and a malignant (low GCase/high α-synuclein) cluster. All healthy controls 
belonged to the benign cluster, while 59% of GBA-PD and 47% of GBA-nonPD fell 
into the malignant cluster. GBA-nonPD within the malignant cluster had greater 
depressive symptoms, and GBA-PD showed worse cognitive performance.
CONCLUSIONS: We report for the first time that the combined assessment of blood 
GCase activity and α-synuclein levels can define two distinctive biochemical 
clusters able to discriminate GBA-nonPD subjects with greater preclinical 
non-motor symptoms and GBA-PD patients with a worse cognitive profile. 
Longitudinal studies are needed to confirm the accuracy of this potential 
biomarker.

Complex V of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system is an ATP 
synthase that plays a pivotal role in the cell's energy transduction. Mutations 
in genes encoding the multiple protein subunits that constitute complex V cause 
severe metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. We present here three 
complementary assays to assess Complex V activity and assembly in peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The assays involve spectrophotometric and 
in-gel activity measurements, cytochemical assessment of the mitochondrial 
transmembrane electrochemical gradient (∆Ѱm) to determine if the enzyme acts 
forward as an ATP synthase or in reverse as an ATPase, and western blot analysis 
of clear native gels to evaluate Complex V assembly. The whole process can be 
performed with 2 × 106 PBMCs isolated from ~2 ml of blood. Our study suggests 
that PBMCs can serve as a platform for small-scale, minimally invasive 
investigations of patients suspected of Complex V deficiency or in biomarker 
research of mitochondrial function.

IMPORTANCE: The role of pesticide exposure from golf courses in Parkinson 
disease (PD) risk remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether proximity to golf courses is associated with 
increased PD risk and to use information on groundwater vulnerability and 
municipal well locations to investigate drinking water contamination as a 
potential route of exposure.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This case-control study included patients 
with incident PD and matched controls from the Rochester Epidemiology Project 
from 1991 to 2015. Data were analyzed between June and August 2024.
EXPOSURES: Distance to golf courses, living in water service areas with a golf 
course, living in water service areas in vulnerable groundwater regions, living 
in water service areas with shallow municipal wells, and living in water service 
areas with a municipal well on a golf course.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Risk of incident PD. All models adjusted for age, 
sex, race and ethnicity, year of index, median household income, and urban or 
rural category.
RESULTS: A total of 419 incident PD cases were identified (median [IQR] age, 73 
[65-80] years; 257 male [61.3%]) with 5113 matched controls (median [IQR] age, 
72 [65-79] years; 3043 male [59.5%]; 4504 White [88.1%]). After adjusting for 
patient demographics and neighborhood characteristics, living within 1 mile of a 
golf course was associated with 126% increased odds of developing PD compared 
with individuals living more than 6 miles away from a golf course (adjusted odds 
ratio [aOR], 2.26; 95% CI, 1.09-4.70). Individuals living within water service 
areas with a golf course had nearly double the odds of PD compared with 
individuals in water service areas without golf courses (aOR, 1.96; 95% CI, 
1.20-3.23) and 49% greater odds compared with individuals with private wells 
(aOR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.05-2.13). Additionally, individuals living in water 
service areas with a golf course in vulnerable groundwater regions had 82% 
greater odds of developing PD compared with those in nonvulnerable groundwater 
regions (aOR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.09-3.03).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this population-based case-control study, the 
greatest risk of PD was found within 1 to 3 miles of a golf course and risk 
generally decreased with distance. Associations with the largest effect sizes 
were in water service areas with a golf course and in vulnerable ground water 
regions.

Extracellular vesicles released from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs-EV) have shown 
anti-inflammatory effects in Parkinson's disease (PD). This study was designed 
to assess the neuroprotective effects of human umbilical cord MSCs (hucMSCs) and 
the possible mechanisms involved. SH-SY5Y cells were induced with MPP+, and the 
impact of hucMSCs-EV on the damage to SH-SY5Y cells was examined. Mice were 
induced with PD-like symptoms by MPTP and the effects of hucMSCs-EV on 
neurological damage in mouse brain tissue were detected as well. HucMSCs-EV 
inhibited apoptosis and oxidative stress in MPP+-induced SH-SY5Y cells. 
HucMSCs-EV suppressed behavioral deficits and neuronal apoptosis in MPTP-induced 
mice, with an increased number of dopamine neurons in brain tissues and 
decreased p-alpha-syn expression in dopamine neurons. The expression of 
ribosomal protein S27A (RPS27A) in SH-SY5Y cells was elevated after co-culture 
of neurons and hucMSCs-EV, and RPS27A silencing abated the effect of hucMSCs-EV 
in vivo and in vitro. RPS27A bound to the MDM2 promoter, thus promoting P53 
ubiquitination and degradation. MDM2 overexpression strengthened the therapeutic 
effect of hucMSCs-EV. We conclude that hucMSCs-EV promote the interaction 
between RPS27A and MDM2 by delivering RPS27A, which regulates the MDM2-P53 axis 
to promote degradation of P53 to ameliorate neurological damage in PD.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by dopaminergic neurodegeneration and 
α-synuclein aggregation. The neurotoxin 
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), used to replicate PD 
symptoms, disrupts erythropoiesis, leading to anemia, potentially contributing 
to dopaminergic neurotoxin-induced developmental toxicity and further 
investigation into novel therapeutic approaches for reversing PD pathology is 
strongly advocated. The monoterpene α-terpineol (α-TPN) exhibits several 
pharmacological effects, including neuroprotection. This study aims to 
investigate the developmental and neuroprotective roles of α-TPN in a PD model 
of zebrafish embryos induced by MPTP. Our findings suggest that α-TPN 
significantly guards early developmental processes, as evidenced by improved 
survival rates, enhanced hatching rates, stabilized heart rate and amelioration 
of phenotypic abnormalities. In addition, α-TPN shows strong neuroprotective 
effects by enhancing locomotor function and improving acetylcholinesterase 
(AChE) activity in MPTP larvae. Moreover, α-TPN markedly reduces oxidative 
stress by lowering intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid 
accumulation and apoptotic signatures. Collectively our findings highlight the 
dual role of α-TPN in promoting healthy development and protecting MPTP 
toxicity, emphasizing its potential as a therapeutic candidate for PD and 
related neurodegenerative disorders.

INTRODUCTION: P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or multidrug-resistance protein is one of 
the most extensively studied efflux transporters at the blood-brain barrier 
(BBB). Changes in P-gp function are associated with several neurodegenerative 
and psychiatric diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and 
schizophrenia and with the bioavailability of several pharmaceuticals in the 
brain, causing multi-drug resistance or side effects. PET imaging can be used to 
measure the P-gp function in vivo. This study aims to validate [18F]MC225 as 
specific P-gp PET tracer with the use of cyclosporin as selective P-gp 
inhibitor.
METHODS: Fourteen healthy volunteers (age 67 ± 5y) were included. Subjects 
underwent twice a 60 min dynamic [18F]MC225 (200MBq) PET scan with continuous 
arterial blood sampling and a cerebral T1-weighted MRI as anatomical reference. 
During the second scan, in five subjects, cyclosporin was administered in a dose 
of 2.5 mg/kg/hour, starting 30 min prior to the scan, to inhibit the BBB P-gp 
function. Tissue time-activity curves of preselected brain regions (Hammer's 
atlas) were fitted to a reversible two-tissue compartment model (2T4k) using the 
metabolite corrected plasma and uncorrected whole blood curves as input 
functions.
RESULTS: No significant difference was found in plasma kinetics, plasma curves, 
plasma-to-whole blood ratio, and the parent fraction of the baseline scans and 
scans after administration of cyclosporin. Volume of distribution values in 
whole brain grey matter showed a significant increase (6.18 ± 1.29 to 
9.00 ± 1.29 mL·cm- 3,p = 0.03) after the administration of cyclosporin.
CONCLUSION: The outcomes of the current study reflect the potential ability of 
[18F]MC225 to measure cyclosporin induced changes in P-gp function at the human 
BBB in vivo.

Osteocalcin (OCN), a small protein secreted by osteoblasts, has attracted 
significant attention for its role as an endocrine factor in regulating the 
central nervous system (CNS) via the bone-brain axis. As a critical receptor for 
OCN, G protein-coupled receptor 158 (GPR158) facilitates the proliferation, 
differentiation, and survival of neural cells while directly influencing 
neurons' structural and functional plasticity, thereby modulating cognitive 
function. Additionally, GPR158 is involved in cellular energy metabolism and 
interacts with proteins such as regulators of G protein signaling 7 (RGS7), 
broadening the understanding of OCN's impact on neural activity. Notably, GPR158 
displays region- and cell type-specific bidirectional effects under certain 
pathological conditions, such as tumor development and mood regulation, adding 
complexity to its mechanisms of action. Although the precise biological 
mechanisms underlying the OCN/GPR158 signaling pathway remain incompletely 
understood, its association with neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), including 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), is becoming increasingly 
evident. Thus, a systematic summary of OCN/GPR158 in CNS regulation and NDs will 
deepen understanding of its role in brain function and support the development 
of new therapeutic targets and strategies.

Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a cardiac disorder characterized by an 
accessory pathway known as the bundle of Kent, which bypasses the 
atrioventricular node and predisposes patients to tachyarrhythmias, including 
supraventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation. The prevalence of WPW 
syndrome ranges from 0.1% to 0.5% globally, with a higher incidence in males and 
diagnosis typically occurring between ages 10 and 30. Although many individuals 
remain asymptomatic, WPW presents a risk of life-threatening arrhythmias, 
including sudden cardiac death, particularly when atrial fibrillation progresses 
to ventricular fibrillation (VF). Effective risk stratification is essential for 
managing WPW syndrome; this involves evaluating symptomatic presentation, 
accessory pathway properties, and underlying cardiac conditions using clinical, 
electrocardiographic, and electrophysiological data. Recent advances in risk 
stratification models enable clinicians to identify better patients at high risk 
for arrhythmia recurrence or sudden death, informing treatment strategies such 
as catheter ablation. This study emphasizes the importance of personalized risk 
assessment in guiding therapeutic decisions, minimizing unnecessary 
interventions, and improving outcomes. This review's novel contribution lies in 
its updated analysis of risk stratification models, which incorporates new 
research on the genetic and epidemiological factors influencing WPW syndrome. 
This analysis emphasizes the evolving role of catheter ablation as a first-line 
treatment for high-risk patients, demonstrating its potential to provide 
long-term arrhythmia control with minimal complications. Our findings underscore 
the necessity for ongoing post-ablation surveillance to monitor for recurrence 
and to optimize patient care, ultimately improving clinical outcomes.

PURPOSE: To determine the relationship of retinal microcirculatory responses to 
cognitive function following yoga training in patients with Parkinson's disease 
(PD).
METHODS: Twenty patients with diagnosed PD were recruited, and retinal imaging 
was successful on 17 patients (age 71.8 ± 7.2 years old, nine females). Retinal 
capillary perfusion density (CPD) was imaged using optical coherence tomography 
angiography (OCTA), and retinal blood flow (RBF) was imaged using a retinal 
function imager (RFI). All patients participated in three 1-hour YogaCue or 
Hatha yoga classes per week for 24 consecutive weeks. Pearson correlation 
analyses determined the relationship between the changes in retinal 
microcirculatory responses and cognitive function.
RESULTS: Increased RBF was significantly related to the changes of CPD in all 
retinal slabs, including superficial and deeper vascular plexuses and retinal 
vascular network (6 mm scan, r ranged 0.58-0.83, P < 0.05). The increased RBF 
and CPD of superficial vascular plexus (6 mm scan) were related to the 
improvements (i.e., shorter time) in trail-making A performance (r = -0.66, 
P < 0.01 and r = -0.58, P < 0.05, respectively). In addition, the change of CPD 
in the retinal vascular network was related to improvement in Hopkins verbal 
delayed recall (r = 0.50, P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: This is the first study exploring the relationship between retinal 
microcirculatory responses to yoga exercise and cognitive function in PD 
patients. The synergistic effect of CPD and RBF may be developed into ocular 
indicators for monitoring the effect of cognitive improvement from yoga exercise 
in patients with PD.

OBJECTIVE: Characteristic ocular symptoms are expected to serve as potential 
biomarkers for early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, possible 
ocular impairments in PD patients are rarely studied. The study aimed to 
investigate eye movement characteristics and pupil diameter changes in 
early-stage PD patients using virtual reality (VR)-based system and explore 
their contribution in the diagnosis of early-stage PD.
METHODS: Forty-three early-stage PD patients and 25 healthy controls were 
included. Eye movements and pupillary response of all subjects were recorded and 
evaluated by wearing VR glasses. All subjects completed pro-saccade and 
anti-saccade tasks. Saccadic eye movement and pupillary response parameters were 
analyzed. Random Forests method was used for classification task, the 
performance of the classification model in differentiating early-stage PD 
patients from healthy controls were evaluated.
RESULTS: PD patients exhibited reduced pro-saccade velocity and accuracy, longer 
average time to complete the pro-saccade, and lower anti-saccade error 
correction rate than healthy controls (all p < 0.05). Significant differences 
were found in the trajectories of changes in pupil diameter between the two 
groups. After extraction of frequency-amplitude features of pupil constriction 
from the spectra of the eye movement signals of PD patients, it can be seen that 
the amplitudes of movement signals of both the left and right eyes at different 
frequencies during pro-saccade and anti-saccade tasks were significant. The 
number of significant amplitude frequencies in both eyes at low (0-6 Hz), medium 
(7-12 Hz) and high frequencies (13-19 Hz) was 23, 9, and 16, respectively, 
during pro-saccade task, which was 10, 29, and 43, respectively, during 
anti-saccade task. The model with all features achieved an accuracy of up to 
79%.
CONCLUSION: This study presents a non-invasive approach toward the diagnosis of 
early-stage PD with VR technology. Eye movement and pupillary response 
abnormalities measured using VR may be used as effective biomarkers for the 
diagnosis of early-stage PD.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized 
by a pathology that includes the aggregation of alpha-synuclein (α-syn), 
oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. While existing treatments can alleviate 
motor symptoms, they have limited efficacy in slowing disease progression and 
improving non-motor symptoms. In recent years, molecular hydrogen has been 
recognized for its potential neuroprotective effects, attributed to its 
selective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. While preclinical 
studies demonstrate promising results, clinical trials conducted thus far have 
yielded mixed outcomes, with some trials reporting limited or no therapeutic 
benefit. This review systematically analyzes the mechanisms of action of 
molecular hydrogen in PD and related neurodegenerative disorders, emphasizing 
its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties. By evaluating 
evidence from both preclinical and clinical studies, this paper explores the 
potential of molecular hydrogen to attenuate oxidative stress, modulate 
inflammatory responses, and inhibit apoptosis in neuronal cells, while also 
identifying key gaps in current research. As a novel neuroprotective agent, 
molecular hydrogen holds potential in PD and other neurodegenerative diseases, 
but further well-designed clinical trials are needed to validate its efficacy. 
Future studies should focus on elucidating the mechanisms through which hydrogen 
exerts its neuroprotective effects, particularly concerning α-syn aggregation 
and its clearance pathways, as well as Nrf2-mediated immunomodulation. 
Furthermore, large-scale, multicenter clinical trials are necessary to establish 
efficacy benchmarks and personalized delivery protocols.

Withania somnifera, commonly known as Ashwagandha or Indian ginseng, is a highly 
valued medicinal plant in traditional systems of medicine. This review 
encompasses the bioactive constituents and pharmacological properties of W. 
somnifera, emphasising its potential in addressing numerous health conditions. 
The plant contains many bioactive compounds, such as withanolides, alkaloids, 
and saponins, exhibiting various biological activities. Many pharmacological 
properties of W. somnifera can be noted: adaptogenic, anti-inflammatory, 
antioxidant, anti-diabetic, neuro-protective, and anticancer. Adaptogenic 
properties mask the natural stress response and enhance physiological resilience 
in general, but anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities are very important 
in fighting chronic diseases. Benefits in neuro-protection highlight potential 
use in managing neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's 
disease, while anti-diabetic and anticancer activity underscores metabolic and 
oncological promise. The review further goes on to discuss the mechanisms of 
action, therapeutic applications, and recent advances in W. somnifera research.

BackgroundParkinson's disease (PD) is often accompanied by gastrointestinal 
symptoms. While elevated inflammatory biomarkers have been reported in PD 
patients compared to controls, the role of intestinal dysmotility and 
inflammation in disease manifestation is not fully understood.ObjectiveThis 
study sought to determine if fecal biomarkers and genetic predisposition to 
intestinal inflammation could help identify PD subtypes for future targeted 
therapies.MethodsThe association of disease activity, assessed through United 
Parkinson's disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and Non-Motor Symptoms Questionnaire 
(NMSQ), with constipation severity, fecal calprotectin and six short-chain fatty 
acid (SCFA) levels, polygenic risk scores (PRS) for inflammatory bowel disease 
(IBD) and PD, and microbiota diversity were investigated in 95 participants with 
established PD using regression analyses. Unsupervised k-means clustering was 
applied to stratify PD patients based on inflammatory biomarkers.ResultsHaving 
constipation was linked to worse mentation (UPDRSI, adj.p = 0.03) and more 
limited daily living activities (UPDRSII, adj.p = 0.03), with symptom severity 
linearly associated with higher disease activity (UPDRSI, adj.p = 0.002; 
NMSQ-total, adj.p = 0.02). Fecal calprotectin was elevated in those with 
constipation (p = 0.02) and associated with longer disease duration irrespective 
of the age (adj.p = 0.02). Cluster analysis demonstrated that PD patients with a 
higher non-motor symptom UPDRSII score were more likely to have more severe 
constipation, lower fecal SCFA levels, lower bacterial diversity, and higher 
PRS-CD and PRS-IBD.ConclusionsGut dysmotility, along with pro-inflammatory 
intestinal profiles, and greater genetic predisposition to IBD were observed in 
PD patients with worse non-motor symptoms. Monitoring intestinal biomarkers may 
help identify PD patients for targeted interventions.

Plain Language Summary: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a brain disorder that mostly 
affects movement. However, problems with smell, mood, sleep, and speech are also 
common. In addition, patients with PD often have gut-related issues including 
constipation, characterized by fewer than three bowel movements a week with 
stools that are difficult or painful to pass. Previous studies have shown that 
constipation may emerge years or even decades prior to PD diagnosis and appear 
in up to 80% of PD patients. The goal of our study was to test if gut 
inflammation, changes in the gut bacteria richness, and genetic risk factors, is 
related to how severe disease symptoms are in PD patients. We included 95 people 
with PD diagnosis who provided stool samples to measure inflammatory markers and 
the types of bacteria residing in the gut. We also used blood samples to assess 
genetic risk for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and obtained information about 
their PD symptoms. We found that PD patients with more severe constipation had 
worse symptoms that are not movement related. They also tended to have higher 
levels of inflammation and poorer bacteria richness in the gut. Patients with 
more severe PD symptoms in daily activities were also more likely to have a 
higher genetic risk for IBD. Our results suggest that monitoring biomarkers in 
the gut may help identify PD patients who could benefit from treatments that 
reduce intestinal inflammation and improve bacterial richness. This research 
could eventually help develop new ways to treat or slow down PD.

Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by 
parkinsonism, cerebellar dysfunction, and autonomic failure. Key pathological 
features of MSA include the formation of glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) in 
oligodendrocytes (OLs), myelin loss, and neuroinflammation. Although both 
inflammation and myelination are known to be critical in MSA, the roles of 
myelin proteins and their relationship with inflammation have often been 
overlooked. In this study, we injected AAV-Olig001 vectors carrying either human 
SNCA (AAV-hSNCA) or eGFP (AAV-eGFP) into the striatum of TgM83 transgenic mice, 
which express the A53T mutant form of human alpha-synuclein (αSyn), as well as 
into wild-type (WT) mice. We then assessed myelin protein expression and 
inflammatory responses. TgM83 mice injected with AAV-hSNCA exhibited 
demyelination, increased activation of microglia and astrocytes, and altered 
cytokine and chemokine profiles (including IL-1α, IL-10, IL-12(p40), CCL2, CCL3, 
CCL4, and CCL5), compared to both WT mice and TgM83 mice injected with AAV-eGFP. 
Interestingly, myelin basic protein (MBP) levels were significantly elevated 
around the injection site in TgM83 mice injected with AAV-hSNCA. Notably, we 
observed a positive correlation between MBP expression and inflammatory markers, 
as indicated by Iba1 and GFAP staining. These findings suggest that hSNCA 
overexpression is associated with increased MBP levels and enhanced inflammatory 
responses, implicating that MBP and myelination processes may play previously 
underappreciated roles in the pathogenesis of MSA.

Parkinson's disease (PD) affects 1-2% of the global population and presents 
significant therapeutic challenges. Due to the limitations of existing 
treatments, there is a pressing need for alternative approaches. This study 
investigated the effects of invasive laser acupuncture (ILA), which combines 
acupuncture and photobiomodulation. In this method, optical fibers are inserted 
into the muscle layers of the acupoint to enhance therapeutic outcomes. Mice 
with MPTP-induced PD were treated with ILA at 830 nm or 650 nm. Protective 
effects of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and fibers were assessed by 
examining TH immunoreactivity in the brain. Neuroinflammation markers in the 
brain and muscle metabolomic profiles were also analyzed. Comparisons between 
invasive and non-invasive laser application, as well as the impact of nerve 
blocking with lidocaine, were also evaluated. ILA at 830 nm (ILA830) 
significantly improved motor performance and increased the nigrostriatal 
TH-positive immunoreactivities. It reduced the levels of α-synuclein, apoptotic 
proteins, and inflammatory cytokines, while increasing anti-inflammatory in the 
brain. ILA830 also decreased nigrostriatal astrocyte and microglia activation. 
Muscle metabolomic analysis showed distinct group clustering and significant 
changes in metabolites like glucose and galactose, correlating with improved 
motor functions. Invasive laser treatment was more effective than non-invasive, 
and lidocaine pre-treatment did not block its effects. ILA at 830 nm effectively 
ameliorates PD symptoms by protecting dopaminergic neurons, and reducing 
neuroinflammation in the brain. Muscle metabolomic changes by ILA830, such as 
increased glucose and galactose, correlate with motor improvement. This approach 
offers a promising strategy for PD treatment, warranting further research to 
optimize its use in clinical settings.

We conducted PET imaging with [18F]FDOPA and dopamine D2/3 receptor ligand 
[18F]fallypride in aged transgenic rats carrying human pathogenic LRRK2 R1441C 
or G2019S mutations. These rats have mild age-dependent deficits in dopamine 
release restricted to dorsal striatum despite no overt loss of dopamine neurons 
or dopamine content and demonstrate L-DOPA-responsive movement deficits.LRRK2 
mutant rats displayed no deficit in [18F]FDOPA uptake, consistent with intact 
dopamine synthesis in striatal axons. However, LRRK2-R1441C rats demonstrated 
greater binding of [18F]fallypride than LRRK2-G2019S or non-transgenic controls, 
from a regionally selective increase in dorsal striatum. Immunocytochemical 
labelling post-mortem confirmed a greater density of D2 receptors in 
LRRK2-R1441C than other genotypes restricted to dorsal striatum, consistent with 
upregulation of D2-receptors as a compensatory response to the greater dopamine 
release deficit previously demonstrated in this genotype.These results show that 
[18F]fallypride PET imaging is sensitive to dysregulation of dopamine signalling 
in the LRRK2-R1441C rat, revealing upregulation of D2 receptors that parallels 
observations in human putamen in early sporadic PD. Future studies of candidate 
therapies could exploit this non-invasive approach to assess treatment efficacy.

The differential impact on working memory (WM) performance of distractors 
presented at encoding or during maintenance was investigated in Alzheimer's 
Disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients, elderly (EHC) and young healthy 
controls (YHC), (n = 28 per group). Participants reported the orientation of an 
arrow from a set of either two or three items, with a distractor present either 
at encoding or at maintenance. MRI data with hippocampal volumes was also 
acquired. Mean absolute error and mixture model metrics i.e., memory precision, 
target detection, misbinding (swapping the features of an object with another 
probed item) and guessing were computed. EHC and PD patients showed good 
filtering abilities both at encoding and maintenance. However, AD patients 
exhibited significant filtering deficits specifically when the distractor 
appeared during maintenance. In healthy ageing there was a prominent decline in 
WM memory precision, whilst in AD lower target detection and higher guessing 
were the main sources of error. Conversely, PD was associated only with higher 
guessing rates. Hippocampal volume was significantly correlated with filtering 
during maintenance - but not at encoding. These findings demonstrate how healthy 
ageing and neurodegenerative diseases exhibit distinct patterns of WM 
impairment, including when filtering irrelevant material either at encoding and 
maintenance.

Air pollution has been associated with Parkinson's Disease (PD) risk, although 
this relationship remains unclear. We estimated yearly levels of exposure to ten 
air pollutants (period 2006-2018) in an Italian population cohort, the Moli-sani 
study (N = 24,325; ≥35 years; 51.9% women), and derived three principal 
components, testing their associations with incident PD risk over 23,841 
participants (213 cases, median(IQR) follow-up 11.2(2.0) years). This revealed a 
statistically significant association of PC1 (explaining 38.2% of common 
variance, tagging PM10 levels), independent on sociodemographic, professional 
and lifestyles covariates (Hazard Ratio [95%CI] = 1.04[1.02-1.07]). The 
association was confirmed testing average PM10 levels during follow-up 
(18[13-24]% increase of PD risk per 1 μg/m3 increase of PM10). Among different 
circulating markers, lipoprotein a explained a significant proportion of this 
association (2.8[0.9; 8.4]%). These findings suggest PM10 as a target to lower 
PD risk at the population level and a potential implication of lipoprotein a in 
PD etiology.

Chronic care manages long-term, progressive conditions, while acute care 
addresses short-term conditions. Chronic conditions increasingly strain health 
systems, which are often unprepared for these demands. This study examines the 
burden of conditions requiring acute versus chronic care, including sequelae. 
Conditions and sequelae from the Global Burden of Diseases Study 2019 were 
classified into acute or chronic care categories. Data were analysed by age, 
sex, and socio-demographic index, presenting total numbers and contributions to 
burden metrics such as Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), Years Lived with 
Disability (YLD), and Years of Life Lost (YLL). Approximately 68% of DALYs were 
attributed to chronic care, while 27% were due to acute care. Chronic care needs 
increased with age, representing 86% of YLDs and 71% of YLLs, and accounting for 
93% of YLDs from sequelae. These findings highlight that chronic care needs far 
exceed acute care needs globally, necessitating health systems to adapt 
accordingly.

There is strong interest in using the gut microbiome for Parkinson's disease 
(PD) diagnosis and treatment. However, a consensus on PD-associated microbiome 
features and a multi-study assessment of their diagnostic value is lacking. 
Here, we present a machine learning meta-analysis of PD microbiome studies of 
unprecedented scale (4489 samples). Within most studies, microbiome-based 
machine learning models accurately classify PD patients (average AUC 71.9%). 
However, these models are study-specific and do not generalise well across other 
studies (average AUC 61%). Training models on multiple datasets improves their 
generalizability (average LOSO AUC 68%) and disease specificity as assessed 
against microbiomes from other neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, 
meta-analysis of shotgun metagenomes delineates PD-associated microbial pathways 
potentially contributing to gut health deterioration and favouring the 
translocation of pathogenic molecules along the gut-brain axis. Strikingly, 
microbial pathways for solvent and pesticide biotransformation are enriched in 
PD. These results align with epidemiological evidence that exposure to these 
molecules increases PD risk and raise the question of whether gut microbes 
modulate their toxicity. Here, we offer the most comprehensive overview to date 
about the PD gut microbiome and provide future reference for its diagnostic and 
functional potential.

By the current estimates, India is likely to face an alarmingly high burden of 
Parkinson's disease (PD) in the next two decades. Untangling the pathophysiology 
of PD through genetic research is the key to precision medicine and prevention 
strategies. This narrative review serves dual purpose of recapitulating 
phenomenology of monogenic diseases presenting with parkinsonism and 
synthesizing knowledge on PD genetics gained through research in India over the 
past two decades. Recent studies have detected rare genetic variants in 15%-20% 
of the early-onset PD patients in India. Due to lack of segregation analysis and 
functional validation, a vast majority of these remain as variants of uncertain 
significance. Nevertheless, several potentially pathogenic variants detected in 
the Indian PD patients are not yet cited in the global genetic databases such as 
Movement Disorder Society Genetic mutation database. Biallelic mutations 
(pathogenic single-nucleotide variants and copy number variants) in the PRKN 
gene account for 3%-5% of monogenic early-onset PD in the Indian population. 
About 2%-3% of the Indian EOPD patients carry pathogenic variants in the genes 
associated with atypical parkinsonism, such as PLA2G6, suggesting that 
initially, they may be indistinguishable from monogenic PD. Up to 10% of the PD 
patients in India carry heterozygous pathogenic variants in GBA1, a risk factor 
gene. Genetic research in India has several critical gaps, such as uneven 
geographic or ethnic representation, discrepancies in variant classification, 
and lack of large-scale genome-wide association studies. Sustained nationwide as 
well as international collaborative efforts are needed to bridge these gaps and 
foster translational science.

Gut commensals regulate neurological disorders through dynamic bidirectional 
communication along the gut-brain axis. Recent evidence has highlighted the 
well-documented beneficial role of the commensal gut bacterium Akkermansia 
muciniphila and its components in promoting host health. However, numerous 
clinical studies have demonstrated a paradoxical role of A. muciniphila in 
individuals with various neurological conditions. In this opinion article, we 
review the correlation between the prevalence of this gut commensal and the 
development of several disorders, including stroke, multiple sclerosis (MS), 
Parkinson's disease (PD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We focus on the 
potential mechanisms by which A. muciniphila may contribute to these diseases. 
An in-depth understanding of these correlations and the underlying pathogenic 
mechanisms could shed new light on the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and 
provide a logical rationale for developing new therapies for these neurological 
conditions.

Neuromelanin is a unique pigment made by some human catecholamine neurons. These 
neurons survive with their neuromelanin content for a lifetime but can also be 
affected by age-related neurodegenerative conditions, as observed using new 
neuromelanin imaging techniques. The limited quantities of neuromelanin has made 
understanding its normal biology difficult, but recent rodent and primate 
models, as well as omics studies, have confirmed its importance for selective 
neuronal loss in Parkinson's disease (PD). We review the development of 
neuromelanin in dopamine versus noradrenaline neurons and focus on previously 
overlooked cellular organelles in neuromelanin formation and function. We 
discuss the role of neuromelanin in stimulating endogenous α-synuclein 
misfolding in PD which renders neuromelanin granules vulnerable, and can 
exacerbates other pathogenic processes.

BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) affects motor and nonmotor functions, 
impacting PD-related quality of life. The role of physical activity (PA) in the 
management of PD symptoms is increasingly recognized.
PURPOSE: To examine the effects of PA levels on PD motor and nonmotor symptoms, 
and health-related quality of life, using the Fox Insight study's data set. It 
also examines PA's moderating effects on the age-PD motor function relationship.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional observational study, 1,288 participants with PD 
(55.8% men, age: 64.54 ± 9.99) from the Fox Insight study were divided into four 
groups (N = 322 each) based on their PA level as measured by the Physical 
Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE). PD motor and nonmotor symptoms were 
assessed using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-2 (UPDRS-2), 
Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-8 (PDQ-8), Geriatric Depression Scale-Short 
Form, Penn Parkinson's Daily Activities Questionnaire-15, and EuroQol-Visual 
Analog Scale. Statistical analyses included Kruskal-Wallis, Pearson's 
correlation, and multiple linear regression, with alpha set at .05.
RESULTS: Higher PASE correlated with better UPDRS-2, Parkinson's Disease 
Questionnaire-8, Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form, Penn Parkinson's Daily 
Activities Questionnaire-15, and EuroQol-Visual Analog Scale. The study found 
significant influences of PASE on UPDRS-2, age, Geriatric Depression Scale-Short 
Form, body mass index, and EQ-VAS (R2adj = .174, F = 53.998, p < .001). Notably, 
PASE moderated the relationship between age and UPDRS-2, suggesting a pivoting 
role in slowing PD-related symptom progression with age (R2adj = .145, F = 
73.47, p < .001).
CONCLUSION: Increased PA levels are associated with better outcomes in PD motor 
and nonmotor symptoms, improved PD-related quality of life, and a slowed 
progression of PD symptoms.
IMPLICATIONS: Promoting higher levels of PA in older adults with PD effectively 
manages motor and nonmotor symptoms of PD. In addition, early and consistent PA 
is the key to moderating the progression of PD symptoms.

BACKGROUND: Evidence linking noise pollution and brain health, particularly at 
mid-to-late life, remains scarce. We investigated the associations between 
long-term exposure to road and railway traffic noise and incident dementia in 
the UK Biobank cohort.
METHODS: Participants with available data for dementia incidence and linked 
traffic noise exposure during follow-up were included. Residential road traffic 
noise from both minor and major roads were calculated in accordance with 
CNOSSOS-EU framework; railway noise estimates were created by Extrium, with the 
raster datasets representing noise contributions from major railway corridors. 
Cox regression was used to quantify the associations between transport noise and 
incident dementia (incl. its subtypes), adjusting for potential confounders, air 
pollution and greenness.
RESULTS: Of the full cohort (n = 502,416), 7668 participants had incident 
dementia during a median follow-up period of 9.67 years. No associations were 
found between all cause dementia incidence and road or railway noise. However, a 
10-dB (dB) higher exposure in annual mean road traffic noise (Lden) was 
significantly associated with incident Alzheimer's disease (HR:1.150, 95 % CI: 
1.022-1.294). The effect estimate was slightly higher when participants were 
exposed to night-time road noise above 45 dB (HR:1.188, 95 % CI:1.012-1.394) and 
this was mediated by the cardiovascular health profile. Railway noise (Lden) was 
significantly associated with incident Parkinson's disease related dementia 
(HR:1.042, 95 % CI:1.005-1.081), however, the effect estimate was slightly 
reduced after further adjustment of air pollution and residential greenness 
(HR:1.037, 95 % CI:0.998-1.077).
CONCLUSION: Distinct associations between different traffic noise exposures and 
incident dementia subtypes were found in this large UK prospective cohort study.

Lingual dystonia, a type of oromandibular focal dystonia, involves sustained 
tongue contractions, often causing protrusion during actions such as speaking or 
chewing. It is classified as either primary or secondary, depending on the 
underlying cause. Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) is a recognized treatment for 
focal dystonias, including lingual dystonia. However, precise administration of 
BoNT can be challenging, limiting its efficacy and potentially causing adverse 
effects. This review focuses on selecting target muscles and using ultrasound 
guidance for accurate BoNT administration. Using ultrasound, with or without 
electromyography, a submental injection approach is employed to target the 
genioglossus and hyoglossus muscles, which are most affected in lingual 
dystonia. The suprahyoid muscles are critical anatomical considerations during 
submental injections to avoid aspiration. Additionally, as drooling is a common 
symptom of lingual dystonia, BoNT injections into the submandibular glands are 
also discussed. A case series with X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism was our way to 
clinically demonstrate BoNT injections in those with severe lingual dystonias.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
involving hallmarks such as α-Synuclein (αSyn) aggregation and dopaminergic 
dysfunction that affect brain-wide neural activity. Although movement disorders 
are prominent in PD, sensory impairments also occur relatively early on, mainly 
in olfactory and, to a lesser extent visual systems. While these deficits have 
been described mainly at the behavioral and molecular levels, the underlying 
network-level activity remains poorly understood. Here, we harnessed a human 
αSyn transgenic mouse model of PD with in vivo functional MRI (fMRI) to map 
evoked activity in the visual and olfactory pathways, along with 
pseudo-Continuous Arterial Spin Labeling (pCASL) and c-FOS measurements to 
disentangle vascular from neuronal effects. Upon stimulation with either odors 
or flickering lights, we found significant decreases in fMRI responses along 
both olfactory and visual pathways, in multiple cortical and subcortical sensory 
areas. Average Cerebral Blood Flow rates were decreased by ∼10% in the αSyn 
group, while c-FOS levels were reduced by over 50%, suggesting a strong neural 
driver for the dysfunction, along with more modest vascular contributions. Our 
study provides insight into brain-level activity in an αSyn-based model, and 
suggests a novel target for biomarking via quantification of simple sensory 
evoked responses.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder that 
primarily impacts middle-aged and older adults. Despite advances in research, 
the underlying pathophysiology of PD is not fully understood. Although quercetin 
(Que) and other therapeutic agents show promise in reducing neuronal damage, and 
certain adjuvant treatments help improve patient recovery, there is no specific 
drug or treatment for PD. Recent studies have demonstrated that cell mechanical 
properties can be important indicators of cellular health, providing a new 
perspective for exploring PD pathogenesis. In this study, we developed a PD cell 
damage model to explore changes in the mechanical characteristics of PD cells 
before and after treatment with Que, as well as Que combined with red-light 
stimulation. Atomic force microscopy was employed to investigate these 
mechanical alterations. Furthermore, biological assays were carried out to 
elucidate the mechanisms by which these treatments inhibit cell damage, which 
provided a new approach for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of PD 
interventions.

BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder causing physical 
and psychological challenges. Stigma exacerbates negative emotions, resulting in 
anxiety and depression, as well as undermining self-perception and social 
participation. Health literacy aids in disease management, and family function 
plays a crucial supportive role. However, the interplay between these variables 
remains underexplored.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the chain mediating effects of health literacy and family 
function between stigma and negative emotions in patients with Parkinson's 
disease.
METHODS: This study adopted a cross-sectional design, recruiting eligible 
patients from a tertiary hospital in Guangzhou, China. A total of 245 
participants completed questionnaires on stigma, health literacy, family 
function and negative emotions. Statistical analyses were performed using 
Spearman's correlation and mediation effect analysis.
RESULTS: Negative emotions were positively correlated with stigma (β = 0.584) 
and inversely associated with health literacy (β = -0.258) and family function 
(β = -0.144). Mediation effect analysis showed that the mediating effects of 
health literacy, family function, and their combined effects on the relationship 
between stigma and negative emotions were 0.033, 0.020, and 0.008, respectively, 
accounting for 8.89%, 5.39%, and 2.16% of the total effect.
CONCLUSIONS: Stigma in patients with Parkinson's disease not only directly 
affects negative emotions but also indirectly influences them through health 
literacy and family function.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Consumption of ultraprocessed foods (UPFs) has been 
associated with a higher risk of various chronic diseases, but its relation to 
prodromal Parkinson disease (PD) remains unclear. We aimed to assess the 
association between long-term UPF consumption and nonmotor features suggestive 
of prodromal PD.
METHODS: This longitudinal analysis included participants without a history of 
PD from the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. UPF 
consumption was assessed using repeated food frequency questionnaires 
(1984-2006) and grouped based on Nova classification. Participants provided data 
on probable REM sleep behavior disorder (pRBD) and constipation in 2012. Between 
2014 and 2015, a subset of participants provided data on 5 additional nonmotor 
features, including hyposmia, impaired color vision, excessive daytime 
sleepiness, body pain, and depressive symptoms. The primary outcome was the 
combination of all 7 prodromal features and further categorized as 0 
(reference), 1, 2, and ≥3 features. The secondary outcomes were all features 
except constipation, a combination of 3 commonly recognized features 
(constipation, pRBD, and hyposmia), and individual features. Multinomial 
logistic regression was used to estimate the association of UPF consumption with 
the combination of prodromal features. The association between UPF consumption 
and each individual feature was further examined using logistic regression.
RESULTS: The study analyzed 42,853 participants (25,095 women [58.6%]; mean [SD] 
age, 47.8 [5.2] years). Comparing extreme quintiles of UPF consumption, the 
multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (OR) for having ≥3 vs 0 prodromal features was 
2.47 (95% CI 1.89-3.23, ptrend < 0.0001) for cumulative average intake and 1.50 
(95% CI 1.18-1.89, ptrend = 0.0009) for baseline intake. Similar results were 
observed for combinations of all features except constipation (OR 2.00, 95% CI 
1.29-3.11, ptrend < 0.0001) and combinations of 3 features (OR 2.47, 95% CI 
1.41-4.34, ptrend = 0.008). In addition, higher UPF consumption was associated 
with increased odds of individual prodromal features, including pRBD, 
constipation, body pain, and depressive symptoms.
DISCUSSION: Long-term UPF consumption was positively associated with nonmotor 
prodromal PD features. More studies are warranted to confirm whether lowering 
UPF consumption may prevent the occurrence of nonmotor symptoms that often 
precede PD diagnosis.

Treatment Acceptability and Satisfaction With Cough Skill Training in 
Parkinson's Disease: A Mixed-Methods Study.

PURPOSE: Despite evidence to suggest that rehabilitation can improve airway 
protection in people with Parkinson's disease (pwPD), rehabilitative therapies 
are underutilized. One newer treatment approach with growing evidence to support 
its efficacy is cough skill training (CST). To improve utilization of 
rehabilitations such as CST, it is important to understand patient treatment 
experience. Therefore, the aim of this study was to define treatment 
acceptability and satisfaction of CST in pwPD.
METHOD: Thirteen pwPD were consecutively recruited from a trial during which 
participants completed two in-person sessions of CST via spirometry over 2 
weeks. A mixed-methods approach was used, whereby quantitative data (obtained 
from questionnaires) and qualitative data (obtained from semistructured 
interviews) were integrated to provide a holistic understanding of patient 
experience. Data collection and thematic analyses (of qualitative data) were 
guided by the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety framework.
RESULTS: While treatment demonstrated adequate acceptability with a System 
Usability Scale median score of 70/100 (scores ≥ 70 indicate acceptability), 
integrative examination of patient experience revealed several themes that 
highlight barriers and facilitators to treatment acceptability-as they relate to 
CST tools (visualization, lip seal, and measurement accuracy) and tasks 
(practice targets, feedback, practice amount, and future training). Most (61.5%) 
participants were "satisfied" or "very satisfied" with CST. Four themes emerged 
related to satisfaction: treatment relevance, patient awareness and control over 
their disease, skill acquisition, and skill transference to real-life choking 
events.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, patient responses indicated that small, personalized 
adaptations to equipment, training targets, and feedback may enhance their 
experiences, while education and personalized goal setting may enhance treatment 
relevance and perceived benefit. Patient perspectives and needs can inform the 
refinement of person-centered clinical implementation of CST and improve 
treatment uptake.

Medical College, Shantou, Guangdong 515041, China.

This review aims to explore the potential application of α-synuclein (α-syn) 
molecular probes in the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD), 
particularly through systematic evaluation using medical imaging methods. In 
recent years, The abnormal aggregation of α-syn within the central nervous 
system is now recognized as a central driver of PD pathophysiology, solidifying 
its role as a critical diagnostic and prognostic biomarker. Early diagnosis of 
PD is critical for enabling precision therapeutic interventions and mitigating 
neurodegenerative progression, thereby enhancing long-term functional outcomes 
and the quality of life. However, challenges remain in clinical practice, 
particularly concerning the late timing of diagnosis and the lack of specific 
biomarkers. By analyzing the existing literature, we will assess the 
effectiveness of different imaging techniques combined with α-syn probes and 
discuss their advantages and limitations in clinical applications. These imaging 
methods can provide visualization of early pathological changes, helping to 
improve the recognition rate of PD. Finally, we emphasize the importance of 
future research to explore new molecular probes and imaging technologies that 
can improve early diagnosis rates and treatment outcomes for PD.

OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to identify interventions aiming to improve 
awareness of and reduce stigma related to neurodegenerative conditions within 
South Asian and Black (African-Caribbean, African, African American, Black 
British) communities with a focus on synthesising the methods employed for 
culturally tailoring interventions.
INTRODUCTION: Minority ethnic communities affected by neurodegenerative 
conditions often face health and social care disparities. This can lead to 
delayed diagnosis and poor health outcomes. Interventions that provide relevant, 
accessible information about neurodegenerative conditions may help reduce 
disparities in care access. There is limited knowledge about the methods used to 
culturally tailor interventions for minority ethnic communities and their 
efficacy.
INCLUSION CRITERIA: Eligible sources will include interventions specifically 
tailored for South Asian and Black communities, living with dementia, 
Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, or motor neurone disease. 
Interventions must be conducted in countries that are member states of the 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development where these two groups 
constitute minority populations and are likely to face inequalities in care 
access.
METHODS: A scoping review guided by the Joanna Briggs Institute Manual for 
Evidence Synthesis will be conducted. Searches of Medline (EBSCO), APA PsycInfo 
(EBSCO), and EMBASE (Elsevier) will be conducted. Study selection will be based 
on 100% agreement between two reviewers. Data will be extracted, charted, and 
summarised narratively followed by consultation with stakeholders.
IMPLICATIONS: This review will identify culturally sensitive strategies for 
raising awareness and reducing the stigma associated with neurodegenerative 
conditions among South Asian and Black communities within the Organisation for 
Economic Co-operation and Development countries. By utilising these inclusive 
approaches, communities may feel more empowered to seek a diagnosis for symptoms 
and live better with the condition. The findings of this review will be shared 
with the public and policymakers to promote awareness and evidence-based policy 
making.

neurodegeneration through the interleukin enhancer binding factor 3-microRNA-7 
pathway.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a loss 
of dopaminergic neurons. Recent studies suggested the association of zinc finger 
protein 184 (ZNF184) with PD. However, the functional role of ZNF184 in PD 
pathogenesis remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to confirm this association 
and the effects of ZNF184 in a mouse model of PD and human patients with PD. We 
found that ZNF184 levels were decreased in the substantia nigra (SN) of 
α-synuclein preformed fibril (α-syn PFF)-injected mice and cells treated with PD 
toxins. Furthermore, ZNF184 was reduced in the cortex and SN of patients with 
PD, suggesting an association between ZNF184 and PD pathogenesis. In 
ZNF184-overexpressing cells, RNA-sequencing analysis revealed significant 
alterations in several protein-coding genes including interleukin enhancer 
binding factor 3 (ILF3). Bioinformatic analysis identified potential ZNF184 
binding motifs within the ILF3 promoter, and ZNF184 occupancy was confirmed. 
Since ILF3 inhibits the biogenesis of microRNA-7 (miR-7), which regulates 
α-synuclein aggregation, we administered the miR-7 inducer, scutellarin to α-syn 
PFF-injected mice, preventing dopaminergic neuron and reinstating motor 
abilities. Our findings suggest that ZNF184 promotes miR-7 upregulation by 
suppressing ILF3 transcription, revealing a novel pathway that could serve as a 
promising therapeutic target for the treatment of PD.

Biallelic mutations in the glucosylceramidase beta 1 (GBA1) gene are the 
underlying genetic cause of Gaucher's disease (GD), resulting in a deficient 
lysosomal hydrolase and subsequent accumulation of glycosphingolipids. More 
recently, GBA1 mutations have been identified as the most prevalent genetic risk 
factor for Parkinson's disease (PD), associated with more pronounced symptoms 
characterized by earlier onset and accelerated cognitive decline. In these 
GBA-associated PD patients the α-synuclein pathology is more prominent, and 
recent data suggest a link between α-synucleinopathies and GBA1 mutations. Here, 
we explored the effect of GBA1 gene supplementation on the GD phenotypes and 
α-synuclein pathology by using the adeno-associated virus (AAV) system. We have 
compared two AAV serotypes, AAV5 and AAV9, and two different ubiquitous 
promoters, and demonstrate that both promoters work efficiently albeit not the 
same in vitro and in vivo. GBA1 overexpression reduces the accumulation of 
glucosylsphingosine (GlcSph) and restores motor dysfunction in a GD mouse model. 
We further demonstrate that GBA1 overexpression can dissolve phospho-α-synuclein 
aggregation induced by the addition of α-synuclein pre-formed fibril (PFF) in a 
mouse primary neuron model suggesting the direct effect of β-Glucocerebrosidase 
(GCase) on α-synuclein accumulation. In vivo, we show that GCase inhibition can 
induce insoluble high-molecular-weight α-synuclein aggregation and that delivery 
of GBA1 achieves robust reduction of the α-synuclein aggregates in the mouse 
brain. In summary, GCase expression not only reduces GlcSph, but also restores 
GD motor dysfunction and removes α-synuclein aggregates which are the hallmark 
for PD and α-synucleinopathies. AAV delivery of GBA1 is a powerful approach to 
restore glucocerebrosidase function and to resolve misfolded α-synuclein 
protein, with applications for GD and PD.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with 
debilitating non-motor symptoms, including gastrointestinal dysfunction, 
cardiovascular abnormalities, mood and anxiety disorders, cognitive decline, 
sleep disturbances, respiratory dysfunction, and pain. Despite their significant 
impact on quality of life, these symptoms are often inadequately addressed. 
Propolis is a natural bee-derived product, rich in bioactive compounds with 
anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective 
properties, which holds potential in PD due to its multitarget and multipathway 
actions, addressing various underlying mechanisms of non-motor symptom diseases. 
Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that propolis may influence key 
pathological mechanisms in PD's non-motor symptoms. Evidence points to its 
potential benefits in improving cognition, mood disorders, gastrointestinal 
health, and alleviating cardiovascular and sleep-related issues. Although 
research on propolis in non-motor symptoms of PD remains scarce, findings from 
related conditions suggest its ability to influence mechanisms associated with 
these symptoms. This review underscores the underexplored therapeutic potential 
of propolis in non-motor symptoms of PD, drawing on existing evidence and 
advocating for further research to fully assess its role in addressing these 
symptoms and improving patient outcomes.

Human Endogenous Retroviruses comprise approximately 8% of the human genome, 
serving as fragments of ancient retroviral infections. Although they are 
generally maintained in a silenced state by robust epigenetic mechanisms, 
specific HERV groups, particularly HERV-W and HERV-K, can become derepressed 
under specific pathological conditions, thereby contributing to the initiation 
and progression of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes. 
Preclinical studies and clinical trials, such as those investigating monoclonal 
antibodies, indicate that directly targeting these elements may offer a novel 
therapeutic strategy. In this review, we provide an overview of HERVs' biology, 
examine their role in neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease, and 
explore their therapeutic prospects, highlighting both the challenges and the 
potential future research directions needed to translate these approaches into 
clinical interventions.

IMPORTANCE: In 2019, an alleged "mystery" neurological illness emerged in New 
Brunswick, Canada. Despite extensive media attention, no case description has 
been published to date.
OBJECTIVE: To report on 25 patients with a diagnosis of New Brunswick 
neurological syndrome of unknown cause (NSUC) who subsequently received a 
second, independent clinical reassessment or neuropathological examination 
between 2020 and 2025.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study of cases derived 
from a cohort of patients (n = 222) who had received an NSUC diagnosis. Four 
movement disorder neurologists and 2 behavioral neurologists carried out 
clinical evaluations at 2 hospitals in New Brunswick and Ontario, Canada. 
Neuropathological diagnoses were obtained in Ontario by a neuropathologist and a 
second reviewer, both blinded to the case histories. Eligible patients were 
offered a second opinion; 4 families of deceased patients provided consent for 
reporting autopsies and waivers of consent were obtained for 7.
EXPOSURE: NSUC as described in the case definition circulated by Public Health 
New Brunswick in 2021.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Findings from the independent clinical evaluations 
and diagnoses obtained through neuropathological examination.
RESULTS: Among 105 eligible patients, 14 patients (aged 20-55 years; 8 female, 6 
male) received clinical evaluations, and 11 patients (aged 56-82 years; 5 
female, 6 male) had neuropathological diagnoses. Well-known conditions were 
identified in all 25 cases, including common neurodegenerative diseases, 
functional neurological disorder, traumatic brain injury, and metastatic cancer. 
Based on the 11 autopsy cases, a new disease was extremely unlikely, with a 
probability less than .001. When applying the 95% confidence interval for the 
true probability of no new disease, the data revealed a high probability between 
87% and 100%.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: There was no evidence supporting a diagnosis of NSUC 
in this cohort. The data inclusive of independent examinations and 
neuropathology strongly supported the presence of several neurodegenerative and 
non-neurodegenerative conditions. Unfounded concerns that a potentially fatal 
mystery disease, possibly induced by an environmental toxin, is causing the 
patients' neurological symptoms has been amplified in traditional and social 
media. Second, independent clinical evaluations are needed for any patient given 
a diagnosis of NSUC.

Neurological diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and stroke, 
represent significant medical challenges due to their complexity and the 
limitations of current treatment approaches. This review explores the potential 
of stem cell (SC)-derived exosomes (Exos) as a transformative therapeutic 
strategy for these diseases. Exos, especially those derived from SCs, exhibit 
natural targeting ability, biocompatibility, and the capacity to cross the 
blood-brain barrier (BBB), making them ideal vehicles for drug delivery. This 
review provides an in-depth discussion of the properties and advantages of 
SC-Exos. It highlights their potential synergistic benefits in therapeutic 
approaches to treat neurological diseases. This article discusses the mechanisms 
of action of SC-Exos, highlighting their ability to target specific cells, 
modulate disease pathways, and provide controlled release of therapeutic agents. 
Applications in specific neurological disorders have been investigated, 
demonstrating the potential to improve outcomes in conditions such as 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD), and stroke. Moreover, 
Exos-coated nanoparticles (NPs) combine the natural properties of Exos with the 
multifunctionality of NPs. This integration takes advantage of exosome membrane 
biocompatibility and targeting capabilities while preserving NPs' beneficial 
features, such as drug loading and controlled release. As a result, Exos-coated 
NPs may enhance the precision, efficacy, and safety of therapeutic 
interventions. In conclusion, SC-Exos represent a promising and innovative 
approach to treating neurological diseases.

A distinct immune microenvironment may develop in patients with Parkinson's 
disease (PD), influenced by the severity of cognitive impairment and the 
presence of depression. We aimed to identify blood-based immune response markers 
in patients with PD using a proximity extension assay (PEA). Peripheral plasma 
samples from 58 patients with PD and 30 healthy controls (HCs) were analyzed for 
92 immune response-associated proteins using Olink's PEA technology. A panel of 
four proteins (SIT1, CLEC4C, EIF5A, and NFATC3) was identified, effectively 
differentiating patients with PD from HCs, with a combined area under the 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.863. Among these, ITGA11 and 
EIF5A were particularly associated with the degree of cognitive impairment. 
After applying Bonferroni correction, five proteins-PPP1R9B, MILR1, BTN3A2, 
IRAK1, and TANK-demonstrated potentially significant differences between 
depressed and non-depressed patients with PD-cognitively normal (PD-CN). In the 
correlation analyses, PPP1R9B exhibited a positive correlation with the Hamilton 
Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score (r = 0.509, P = 0.019). Furthermore, after 
adjusting for potential confounding factors in binary logistic regression 
analysis, PPP1R9B remained significantly associated with depression (P = 0.042). 
We identified potential blood-based immune response markers associated with the 
severity of cognitive impairment and depression in patients with PD. These 
findings provide preliminary insights into the immune-related pathology 
underlying non-motor symptoms of PD, potentially guiding future studies aimed at 
targeted therapeutic strategies. Further validation in larger, independent 
cohorts is warranted to confirm these associations and their clinical utility.

Dysregulated dopamine (DA) release in the mesocorticolimbic circuit is noted in 
Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with impulsive and compulsive behaviors 
(ICBs). However, the effect of acute DA release on mood, the localization of 
this process, and the phenotypic differences in patients with ICB remain 
unknown. We applied a placebo-controlled dextro-amphetamine (dAMPH) study in 20 
PD patients: 10 with ICBs (PD-ICB) and 10 without (PD-C). Subjective mood 
experiences were measured with well-described self-reported measures including 
the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), Drug Effects Questionnaire 
(DEQ), and Amphetamine Interview Rating Scale (AIRS). D2-like receptor 
availability was measured as non-displaceable binding potential (BPND) using PET 
imaging with the high-affinity D2/3 receptor ligand [18F]-fallypride. Among all 
the subjects, dAMPH increased the PANAS positive, DEQ feel, DEQ high, and AIRS 
total scores. Increases in the PANAS positive and AIRS total scores were greater 
in the PD-ICB cohort. A mixed-effects model correlated these questionnaire 
changes with dAMPH-induced reductions in BPND in the ventral striatum (VS), 
caudate, amygdala, and caudo-medial orbitofrontal cortex. The baseline caudate, 
VS, and amygdala BPND positively correlated with lower on-dAMPH PANAS positive 
scores. Elevated mood symptoms of acute dAMPH administration in PD are linked to 
DA release in the mesocorticolimbic regions. Distinctions in behavioral effects 
among PD-ICB subjects emphasize that dysregulated striatal and extra-striatal 
DA-ergic networks alter mood responses to stimulated DA release and may also 
contribute to behavioral changes resulting from DA-targeting therapies in PD.

Clinical differentiation between Parkinson's disease (PD) and essential tremor 
(ET) may be challenging, highlighting the need for easily assessable diagnostic 
biomarkers. Neuronally derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs) have been proposed 
as a peripheral matrix that can well recapitulate the cellular composition of 
neurons. We investigated the clinical usefulness of NDEV oligomeric and 
p129-α-synuclein levels in discriminating between patients with PD and those 
with ET. NDEV oligomeric and p129-α-synuclein species were assessed using an 
ELISA in 43 patients with PD, 21 patients with ET, and 45 healthy controls 
(HCs). NDEV oligomeric α-synuclein levels were significantly higher in PD in 
comparison with ET and HCs, while p129-α-synuclein values were significantly 
lower in HCs compared to other groups. By using a receiver operator 
characteristic (ROC) analysis, oligomeric-α-synuclein achieved an excellent 
classification performance in distinguishing PD from both ET and HCs (AUC: 0.976 
and 0.997, respectively), while lower performance was obtained in 
differentiating ET from HCs (AUC: 0.85). On the other hand, p129-α-synuclein 
accurately discriminated both PD and ET from HCs (AUC: 0.997 and 0.952, 
respectively) but had very low performance in differentiating PD from ET (AUC: 
0.47). Our study suggests that NDEV oligomeric α-synuclein is an accurate 
blood-derived biomarker to differentiate PD from ET, while p129-α-synuclein may 
be useful in distinguishing ET from HCs.

Over the past two decades, significant advancements have been made in the 
induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology. These developments have enabled 
the broader application of iPSCs in neuroscience, improved our understanding of 
disease pathogenesis, and advanced the investigation of therapeutic targets and 
methods. Specifically, optimizations in reprogramming protocols, coupled with 
improved neuronal differentiation and maturation techniques, have greatly 
facilitated the generation of iPSC-derived neural cells. The integration of the 
cerebral organoid technology and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing has further 
propelled the application of iPSCs in neurodegenerative diseases to a new stage. 
Patient-derived or CRISPR-edited cerebral neurons and organoids now serve as 
ideal disease models, contributing to our understanding of disease 
pathophysiology and identifying novel therapeutic targets and candidates. In 
this review, we examine the development of iPSC-based models in 
neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, 
and Huntington's disease.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are highly prevalent 
conditions with significant global health impacts. OSA affects 17-34% of 
middle-aged adults, while more than 10 million worldwide have PD. Clinical 
studies demonstrate a bidirectional relationship, with the OSA prevalence being 
higher among PD patients suggesting that hypoxia and sleep fragmentation 
contribute to worsening motor and cognitive symptoms. Conversely, PD-associated 
neurodegeneration impairs respiratory control, exacerbating OSA. Diagnostic 
differentiation is particularly challenging due to overlapping symptoms, such as 
sleep disturbances, cognitive decline, and autonomic dysfunction. Emerging 
neuromodulation therapies, including deep brain stimulation and hypoglossal 
nerve stimulation, show dual therapeutic potential. The interplay between OSA 
and PD draws attention to the need for integrated diagnostic and therapeutic 
approaches. Additional longitudinal studies to evaluate their cause-effect 
relationship and identify neuroimaging and biochemical biomarkers to elucidate 
novel pathophysiologic clues can potentially identify novel therapeutic targets.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) influences the development and progression of 
neurodegenerative disorders in different ways. Homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism is 
related to that of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and group B vitamins. The 
breakdown of the pathway involving nitric oxide (NO) and ADMA can be considered 
one of the causes of endothelial alteration that represents a crucial step in 
the development of several neurodegenerative disorders. Deficiencies of vitamins 
other than group B ones, such as D and A, have also been associated with central 
nervous system disorders. The aim of this narrative review is to describe the 
link between HHcy, ADMA, and vitamins in Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), and multiple sclerosis (MS) in terms of dysfunctional pathways and 
neuropathological processes, performing a literature search from 2015 to 2025 on 
PubMed. This review also provides an overview of the effects of vitamin 
supplementation on neurodegenerative diseases. The alteration of pathways 
involving NO production can lead to HHcy and elevated ADMA concentrations, 
causing neurodegeneration through various mechanisms, while vitamin 
supplementation has been shown to reduce Hcy levels, although with conflicting 
results about the improvement in clinical symptoms. Further studies are needed 
to develop optimal combined therapeutic strategies.

This narrative review presents the role of antioxidants in regulating the gut 
microbiota and the impact on the gut-brain axis, with a particular focus on 
neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease 
(PD). These diseases are characterised by cognitive decline, motor dysfunction, 
and neuroinflammation, all of which are significantly exacerbated by oxidative 
stress. This review elucidates the contribution of oxidative damage to disease 
progression and explores the potential of antioxidants to mitigate these 
pathological processes through modulation of the gut microbiota and associated 
pathways. Based on recent studies retrieved from reputable databases, including 
PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus, this article outlines the mechanisms by 
which antioxidants influence gut health and exert neuroprotective effects. 
Specifically, it discusses how antioxidants, including polyphenols, vitamins, 
and flavonoids, contribute to the reduction in reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
production and neuroinflammation, thereby promoting neuronal survival and 
minimising oxidative damage in the brain. In addition, the article explores the 
role of antioxidants in modulating key molecular pathways involved in oxidative 
stress and neuroinflammation, such as the NF-κB, Nrf2, MAPK, and PI3K/AKT 
pathways, which regulate ROS generation, inflammatory cytokine expression, and 
antioxidant responses essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis in both the 
gut and the central nervous system. In addition, this review explores the 
complex relationship between gut-derived metabolites, oxidative stress, and 
neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting how dysbiosis-an imbalance in the gut 
microbiota-can exacerbate oxidative stress and contribute to neuroinflammation, 
thereby accelerating the progression of such diseases as AD and PD. The review 
also examines the role of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by beneficial 
gut bacteria in modulating these pathways to attenuate neuroinflammation and 
oxidative damage. Furthermore, the article explores the therapeutic potential of 
microbiota-targeted interventions, including antioxidant delivery by probiotics 
and prebiotics, as innovative strategies to restore microbial homeostasis and 
support brain health. By synthesising current knowledge on the interplay between 
antioxidants, the gut-brain axis, and the molecular mechanisms underlying 
neurodegeneration, this review highlights the therapeutic promise of 
antioxidant-based interventions in mitigating oxidative stress and 
neurodegenerative disease progression. It also highlights the need for further 
research into antioxidant-rich dietary strategies and microbiota-focused 
therapies as promising avenues for the prevention and treatment of 
neurodegenerative diseases.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons 
along with the accumulation of amyloid plaques with alpha-synuclein (αS) as the 
major constituent. αS is an intrinsically disordered protein with the potential 
to undergo a cascade of structural transitions from a soluble disordered 
conformation to ordered cross-β-sheet-rich insoluble amyloid fibrils. Small 
molecules like polyphenols and peptides with anti-amyloidogenic potential can 
mitigate fibrillation in vitro but fail in vivo owing to poor bioavailability. 
To overcome this problem, a platform that simultaneously enhances the 
bioavailability of the mitigators and efficiently sequesters αS monomers against 
amyloidosis is needed. Accordingly, herein, the sequestering potential of 
surface-moderated zinc oxide nanoparticles was explored; in silico and in vitro 
studies showed that the moderated nano-interfaces efficiently sequestered αS in 
amorphous aggregates, which were termed as flocs. Moreover, GC-MS-based analysis 
of the bio-nano corona highlighted the rationale for efficient sequestering of 
αS monomers against amyloidosis by the biologically synthesized zinc oxide 
nanoparticle compared with other nanoparticle surfaces. Thus, this work 
exemplifies the multimeric interacting interface as a platform to efficiently 
sequester the αS protein and simultaneously enhance the bioavailability of the 
phytochemicals.

Physical rehabilitation complements the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
The applied physical exercises are effective in PD by promoting 
activity-dependent neuroplasticity. The main aim of this study was to assess the 
effect of a 16-week moderate-intensity functional physical rehabilitation 
program (FPR) on the concentration of mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor 
(BDNF) and its precursor (proBDNF) in blood serum and the severity of symptoms 
and quality of life in people with PD. People with PD (Hoehn and Yahr stage 3) 
were randomly assigned to the experimental (FPR) and control (CG) groups. FPR 
participated in movement training to improve functional mobility, motor 
coordination, and balance. Pre- and post-intervention assessments included serum 
levels of proBDNF, mature BDNF, MDS-UPDRS sub-scales, and the PDQ-39 quality of 
life measured. In the FPR group, a statistically significant increase in serum 
proBDNF levels by 39.42% (p = 0.006) was observed, as well as an improvement in 
motor and non-motor aspects of daily functioning, motor complications, and 
overall quality of life. No statistically significant changes in BDNF levels 
were observed. The results indicate that moderately intensive FPR enhances 
neurotrophic mechanisms, primarily through regulating proBDNF and improving 
motor functions and quality of life in patients with PD. The results underline 
the potential of targeted rehabilitation programs to increase neuroplasticity 
and improve clinical outcomes in PD.

Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's 
disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and 
Huntington's disease (HD), represent a significant challenge to global health 
due to their progressive nature and the absence of curative treatments. These 
disorders are characterized by oxidative stress, protein misfolding, and 
neuroinflammation, which collectively contribute to neuronal damage and death. 
Recent advancements in nanotechnology have introduced nanozymes-engineered 
nanomaterials that mimic enzyme-like activities-as promising therapeutic agents. 
This review explores the multifaceted roles of nanozymes in combating oxidative 
stress and inflammation in neurodegenerative conditions. By harnessing their 
potent antioxidant properties, nanozymes can effectively scavenge reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) and restore redox balance, thereby protecting neuronal 
function. Their ability to modify surface properties enhances targeted delivery 
and biocompatibility, making them suitable for various biomedical applications. 
In this review, we highlight recent findings on the design, functionality, and 
therapeutic potential of nanozymes, emphasizing their dual role in addressing 
oxidative stress and pathological features such as protein aggregation. This 
synthesis of current research underscores the innovative potential of nanozymes 
as a proactive therapeutic strategy to halt disease progression and improve 
patient outcomes in neurodegenerative disorders.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting nearly 10 
million people worldwide, and for which no cure is currently known. Mutations in 
the Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene, age, as well as environmental 
factors such as neurotoxin exposure and stress, are known to increase the risk 
of developing the disease in humans. To investigate the role of a specific Asian 
variant of the LRRK2 gene to induce susceptibility to stress and trigger PD 
phenotypes with time, knock-in (KI) mice bearing the human LRRK2 R1628P risk 
variant have been generated and studied from 2 to 16 months of age in the 
presence (or absence) of stress insults, including neurotoxin injections and 
chronic mild stress applied at 3 months of age. Pathophysiological and 
behavioural phenotypes have been measured at different ages and primary neurons 
and fibroblast cells were cultured from the KI mouse line and treated with H2O2 
to study susceptibility towards oxidative stress in vitro. KI mice displayed 
specific PD features and these phenotypes were aggravated by environmental 
stresses. In particular, KI mice developed locomotion impairment and increased 
constipation. In addition, dopamine-related proteins were dysregulated in KI 
mice brains: Dopamine transporter (DAT) was decreased in the midbrain and 
striatum and dopamine levels were increased. Primary fibroblast cells and 
cortical neurons from KI mice also displayed increased susceptibility to 
oxidative stress. Therefore, the LRRK2 R1628P KI mice are an excellent model to 
study the progressive development of PD.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a highly effective 
therapeutic intervention for managing neurological disorders, including 
Parkinson disease. However, conventional lead fixation methods, such as covering 
devices, often lead to complications, including cranial deformities and 
electrode migration. The aim of our study was to present a novel technique that 
integrates n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate adhesive with a titanium "dog-bone" plate for 
DBS lead fixation, to enhance both esthetic and functional outcomes.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 32 patients with 
medication-refractory Parkinson disease or parkinsonism who had previously 
undergone DBS surgery using this fixation technique. The method involved 
applying n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate around the lead at the burr-hole site, followed 
by secondary stabilization with a titanium plate. Intraoperative imaging 
confirmed lead positioning, and patients were monitored for up to 21.6 months 
(±10.2) for migration, infection, and esthetic satisfaction.
RESULTS: All 32 patients showed successful lead fixation without cases of 
migration, displacement, or mechanical failure over the follow-up. No 
postoperative infections, seizures, or meningitis were reported, indicating a 
favorable safety profile. The method provided a smooth cranial contour, with 
high patient satisfaction, especially among those with alopecia or thin skin. In 
addition, the technique potentially reduced operative time because of the rapid 
polymerization of the adhesive, thereby minimizing risks associated with 
prolonged surgeries.
CONCLUSION: The combination of n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate and a titanium "dog-bone" 
plate for DBS lead fixation offers an effective, aesthetically superior, and 
cost-efficient alternative to conventional methods. The reduced complication 
rates and enhanced patient satisfaction suggest that this technique may 
represent a viable future standard for DBS procedures. Further multicenter 
studies are recommended to validate these findings.

[Enriching plasma exosomes for proteomic analysis using a 
phosphatidylserine-imprinted polymer].

Exosomes are 40-160 nm vesicular nano-bodies secreted by most cells that carry 
large amounts of biologically active substances originating from the parent 
cell. Proteins in exosomes are protected by phospholipid bilayer membranes that 
protect them from degradation by enzymes within body fluids. Along with nucleic 
acid, proteins and metabolites, exosomes are biomolecules that are considered to 
be among the most important for discovering tumor markers. Plasma is among the 
most commonly used body fluids in clinical settings; it is highly complex and 
contains many proteins and metabolites that interfere with exosome isolation. 
Consequently, the development of methods for effectively isolating exosomes is a 
key challenge prior to their use in clinical research. In this study, we used a 
phosphatidylserine molecularly imprinted polymer (PS-MIP) to enrich plasma 
exosomes. Subsequent immunoblotting analyses for the CD9, TSG101, and CD81 
exosome marker proteins showed that signals can be detected using only 5 μL of 
plasma, thereby demonstrating the efficiency and specificity of the enrichment 
protocol. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and nanoparticle tracking 
analysis (NTA) data revealed that the enriched vesicles are 30-100 nm in size 
with elliptical or cup-shaped structures, consistent with the morphology and 
particle-size-distribution characteristics of the exosomes, suggesting that 
PS-MIP is capable of successfully isolating exosomes. Nanoflow cytometry 
revealed that 75.4% of the multi-angle laser scattering (MALS) signal is derived 
from the PS-MIP-enriched exosomes, which indicates that these enriched exosomes 
are highly pure and free of interference from impurities, such as aggregated 
protein particles that are similar in size to the exosomes themselves. This 
method was used to analyze the proteomes and potential exosomal protein markers 
of clinical plasma samples from three pancreatic-cancer patients and three 
healthy volunteers. A total of 1052 proteins and 4545 peptides were identified 
in the plasma exosomes of healthy volunteers, with a total of 972 proteins and 
4096 peptides identified in the plasma exosomes of the pancreatic-cancer 
patients. Further bioinformatics analyses revealed that the Vesiclepedia 
database covered 84% of the proteins identified in the plasma exosomes isolated 
using the PS-MIP method; these proteins comprise 77 of the 100 most frequently 
identified exosomal proteins in the ExoCarta database. The identified proteins 
from the cellular components were subjected to gene ontology (GO) analysis, 
which revealed that they are mainly derived from the exosomes, thereby 
demonstrating the high selectivity of the PS-MIP method for enriching plasma 
exosomes and providing specificity for subsequent tumor-marker screening. 
Label-free quantitative analysis showed that 11 proteins were upregulated and 24 
proteins were downregulated in the plasma exosomes of patients with pancreatic 
cancer compared to those of healthy volunteers. The highly expressed and lowly 
expressed proteins in the plasma exosomes of patients with pancreatic cancer 
were subjected to GO, which showed that highly expressed proteins related to the 
positive regulation of metabolic and biological processes were found in the 
plasma exosomes of patients with pancreatic cancer compared to those of healthy 
volunteers, whereas the most significantly under-expressed proteins are related 
immune-system processes, followed by stimulus-responsive, multicellular 
bioprocesses, bioregulatory, and interspecies-interacting 
biological-process-related proteins. The top three proteins, which are 
relatively highly correlated through protein-protein interaction networks (PPI) 
analysis, were determined to be complement factor D (CFD), complement component 
3 (C3), and von Willebrand factor (VWF). Among the upregulated proteins in the 
exosomes of patients with pancreatic cancer, exostosin-like glycosyltransferase 
2 (EXTL2), α-2-macroglobulin like 1 (A2ML1), and Parkinson's disease protein 7 
(PARK7) were the most significantly overexpressed. Hence, these proteins are 
potential biomarkers for the diagnostic and prognostic assessment of pancreatic 
cancer and may provide support for further clinical studies into pancreatic 
cancer.

外泌体是肿瘤标志物的重要来源,血浆作为最常用的临床体液之一,其组成较为复杂且存在大量高丰度蛋白质的干扰,如何有效地从血浆中分离外泌体是临床研究的重要挑战之一。本研究将磷脂酰丝氨酸分子印迹聚合物(PS-MIP)用于血浆外泌体的富集,PS-MIP能够特异性识别外泌体质膜上的磷脂酰丝氨酸,从而实现外泌体的高选择性富集。该方法被用于3例健康志愿者和3例胰腺癌患者的血浆蛋白质组学分析和潜在肿瘤标志物的筛选,在健康对照组中的血浆外泌体中鉴定到了1052种蛋白质和4545条肽段,胰腺癌患者血浆外泌体中鉴定到了972种蛋白质和4096条肽段。将蛋白质组学鉴定到的外泌体蛋白质与包含所有细胞外囊泡分子信息的Vesiclepedia数据库进行比较,结果表明84%的PS-MIP富集的血浆外泌体蛋白质存在于该数据库;与只包含外泌体分子信息的ExoCarta数据库进行比较,发现PS-MIP法鉴定出了ExoCarta数据库中Top 
100外泌体蛋白质中的77种。与健康对照组相比,胰腺癌患者血浆外泌体中表达量上调的蛋白质有11个,下调的蛋白质有24个。蛋白相互作用网络(PPI)分析显示,相关性较高的前3个蛋白质是补体因子D(CFD)、补体C3(C3)和血管性血友病因子(VWF),在胰腺癌患者外泌体的蛋白质组学表达上调的蛋白质中,外泌体蛋白样糖基转移酶2(EXTL2)、α-2-巨球蛋白样1(A2ML1)和人帕金森病蛋白7(PARK7)的差异最为显著,这些蛋白质可能是胰腺癌诊断和预后评估的潜在生物标志物,为胰腺癌的早期诊断和预后提供了重要的科学依据。

INTRODUCTION: Device-aided therapies (DATs) have been developed to provide 
continuous drug delivery (CDD) to people with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) 
whose symptoms can no longer be effectively managed with oral or transdermal 
therapy. Intrajejunal infusion of levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG), 
delivered via the CADD Legacy 1400 pump, is an established CDD option, while 
levodopa-entacapone-carbidopa intestinal gel (LECIG), delivered via the Crono 
LECIG pump, is a more recent addition to the range of DAT options in Europe.
AREAS COVERED: This article explores the rationale for the development of LECIG 
infusion, the role of entacapone in the formulation, and the attributes and 
specifications of the LECIG infusion pump device. Clinical and real-world data 
reporting its efficacy, safety and tolerability of LECIG in advanced PD patients 
from a range of European centers are reviewed, with a focus on the practical 
benefits that a smaller, lighter and quieter device can provide for patients who 
wish to start treatment with intrajejunal levodopa infusion.
EXPERT OPINION: LECIG infusion delivered via the LECIG infusion pump offers 
another valuable DAT option to consider for suitable people with advanced PD 
providing both good long-term clinical benefits and a favorable treatment 
experience for patients.

INTRODUCTION: Magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) has 
shown promising results for a variety of neurological conditions, including 
movement disorders, brain tumors, and degenerative diseases. Recent clinical 
trials have demonstrated that MRgFUS can produce therapeutic effects in 
essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease (PD), comparable to those achieved 
with other neurosurgical interventions. Furthermore, there has been increasing 
attention on the development of FUS technology and its clinical applications, 
aimed at exploring new uses and enhancing existing ones.
AREAS COVERED: In this review, a comprehensive search was conducted across 
multiple platforms, including PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library. Filters 
were applied to include studies based on publication year and clinical trials 
involving human subjects (excluding animal studies). A thorough analysis of the 
results was crucial for achieving the objectives of our research. While some 
studies are still awaiting results, they show promise; others have already been 
completed.
EXPERT OPINION: The authors specifically selected six studies that yielded 
excellent results, covering aspects such as treatment side effects, pain 
location, key findings, ultrasound temperature, and sample size. he aim of this 
review is to provide an overview of the recent literature and ongoing clinical 
trials regarding the application of MRgFUS in the treatment of neuropathic pain.

BACKGROUND: Minor phenomena, including illusions, feeling of presence, and 
passage hallucinations, are common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and may be a risk 
factor for the development of psychosis (hallucinations and delusions).
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the 3-year cumulative 
probability of developing psychosis among individuals with PD minor phenomena.
METHODS: We conducted a 3-year, prospective, observational study of individuals 
with PD minor phenomena with biannual study visits. The presence of psychosis 
was ascertained using the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease 
Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part I Hallucinations and Psychosis item and the 
enhanced Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms in PD (eSAPS-PD). The 
primary outcome variable was the time from baseline to the development of 
psychosis. Proportional hazards regression models were applied to examine 
potential risk factors for the development of psychosis.
RESULTS: We enrolled 38 individuals with PD minor phenomena and included 34 in 
the primary analysis (47% female with mean standard deviation [SD]), with age 
70.3 (7.9) years and mean (SD) time from PD diagnosis 7.5 (5.9) years). 
Twenty-four (71%) of the 34 developed psychosis during follow-up. None of the 
examined demographic or clinical variables were associated with the time to 
development of psychosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Over a 3-year period, there was a high cumulative probability of 
psychosis among individuals with PD minor phenomena in this single-center 
prospective study.

SIGNIFICANCE: Parkinson's disease (PD) is diagnosed when 50% neurodegeneration 
has occurred. The retina could provide biomarkers that would allow for earlier 
diagnosis. Retinal spectroscopy is a technique that could be used to find such 
biomarkers.
AIM: We aimed to find new diagnostic biomarkers for PD following detailed 
spectral examinations of the retina.
APPROACH: The newly developed Zilia Ocular device was used to perform 
spectrometric scans of the optic nerve head (ONH) and the retina of four 
cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) before and after the administration of 
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), a neurotoxin used to 
produce the gold-standard animal model of PD. From the spectrometric data, the 
blood oximetry was calculated, and the diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were 
analyzed to find variations between the two experimental conditions. Post-mortem 
analyses were also performed on the retina of the four parkinsonian monkeys and 
four additional control animals.
RESULTS: The analysis of the DRS indicated a lower slope between the 480- and 
525-nm wavelengths in both the ONH and the retina. Post-mortem measurements of 
the retinal layer thicknesses showed that the outer nuclear layer was 
significantly thinner in MPTP-intoxicated monkeys, compared with controls. 
Altogether, these results indicate that MPTP altered the optical properties of 
the ONH and the retina and show that these variations might be explained by 
MPTP-induced structural changes in the eye fundus, as observed post-mortem.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results indicate that spectroscopy could be used as a 
noninvasive method to detect changes in the retina that occur in PD and that 
such changes could represent retinal biomarkers for improved diagnosis.

IMPORTANCE: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a growing global health concern with the 
number of affected individuals projected to double by 2040. Current treatments 
primarily address motor symptoms but do not prevent disease progression and 
often have significant side effects.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of curcumin as an 
adjunctive treatment for PD, with a focus on its impact on motor and non-motor 
symptoms, quality of life, and neuroprotective mechanisms, especially regarding 
α-synuclein aggregation.
EVIDENCE REVIEW: A systematic search was conducted in Web of Science, Embase, 
PubMed, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library from February to March 2025, using specific 
search terms, and following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. The search strategy used 
the terms ("Parkinson's disease" OR "Parkinson Disease" OR "Parkinsonism") AND 
("Curcumin" OR "Turmeric" OR "Diferuloylmethane" OR "Curcuminoids"), limiting 
results to English-language publications. The Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 Tool was 
used for assessing the risk of bias in RCTs, and the Newcastle-Ottawa scale was 
used for the cohort study.
FINDINGS: The review included two randomized controlled trials and one cohort 
study, comprising a total of 125 PD participants. The studies suggest that 
curcumin may offer modest benefits as an adjunct therapy in PD when administered 
in formulations designed to enhance its bioavailability. Long-term curcumin 
supplementation was associated with a slower deterioration of motor function and 
a tendency to reduce the deposition of phosphorylated α-synuclein in skin 
nerves. A nanomicelle formulation of curcumin significantly improved sleep 
quality and overall quality of life in PD patients over a three-month period, 
while no significant effect was observed on fatigue severity.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Curcumin, particularly in formulations that enhance 
its bioavailability, may be a beneficial add-on treatment for PD, potentially 
improving non-motor symptoms and slowing the advancement of motor dysfunction. 
However, current clinical practice guidelines do not recommend curcumin due to 
the limited and preliminary nature of the evidence. Additional validation 
through larger trials with standardized methodologies is necessary to confirm 
these findings.

BACKGROUND: Observational research suggests that mental diseases may increase 
the risk of gastrointestinal diseases. However, the causal link between these 
conditions remains unclear. In this study, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian 
randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the causal associations between 
common mental diseases and the risk of gastrointestinal diseases.
METHODS: First, a series of parameters were set to select single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Second, A 
two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis was conducted to investigate the 
causal link between mental diseases (Alzheimer's disease, depression, major 
depressive disorder, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia) and gastrointestinal 
diseases (gastritis and duodenitis, gastric cancer) while removing outliers 
using MR-PRESSO. Finally, eight methods of MR analysis were used to generate 
forest plots, including inverse variance weighted (IVW), inverse variance 
weighted (fixed effects) (IVW fixed effects), maximum likelihood (ML), MR-Egger, 
weighted median, penalized weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode, with 
IVW considered the primary method.
RESULTS: The result demonstrated that most MDs have no evidence of a causal link 
between gastrointestinal diseases except Parkinson's disease and gastric cancer 
based on the IVW method (OR = 0.929 [95% CI = 0.869-0.992], p = 0.029). 
Subsequently, we performed a robustness analysis to ensure consistency.
CONCLUSIONS: Our method provided evidence supporting a causal link between 
Parkinson's disease and the risk of gastric cancer. However, no evidence was 
found for other mental diseases influencing the risk of gastrointestinal 
diseases. Further research is warranted to explore how mental diseases affect 
the development of gastrointestinal diseases.

"Unraveling the role of CHRNA6, the neuronal α6 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor 
subunit".

The increased prevalence of electronic cigarettes, particularly among 
adolescents, has escalated concerns about nicotine addiction. Nicotine, a potent 
psychostimulant found in tobacco products, exerts its effects by interacting 
with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the brain. Recent findings in 
both pre-clinical and clinical studies have enhanced our understanding of 
nAChRs, overcoming limitations of pharmacological tools that previously hindered 
their investigation. Of particular interest is the α6 subunit, whose expression 
peaks during adolescence, a critical period of brain development often marked by 
the initiation of substance use. Pre-clinical studies have linked α6-containing 
nAChRs (α6*nAChRs) to nicotine-induced locomotion, dopamine release, and 
self-administration behavior. Furthermore, clinical studies suggest an 
association between the α6 subunit and increased smoking behavior in humans. 
Specifically, a single nucleotide polymorphism in the 3' untranslated region of 
the CHRNA6 gene that encodes for this subunit is linked to smoking behavior and 
other substance use. A comprehensive understanding of this subunit's role in 
addiction is of high importance. This review aims to consolidate current 
knowledge regarding the α6 subunit's functions and implications in addiction and 
other disorders, with the hope of paving the way for future research and the 
development of targeted therapies to address this pressing public health 
concern.

BACKGROUND: Despite clinical observations of emotion-tremor interactions in 
Parkinson's disease (PD), the neurophysiological mechanisms mediating this 
relationship remain poorly characterized.
METHODS: This study employs a multimodal approach integrating 16-channel 
electroencephalography (EEG) and inertial motion sensors to investigate 
emotion-modulated postural tremor dynamics in 20 PD patients and 20 healthy 
controls (HCs) during standardized video-induced emotional states 
(positive/neutral/negative).
RESULTS: Key findings demonstrate impaired negative emotional processing in PD, 
manifested as paradoxical increases in subjective valence (pleasure-displeasure 
ratings) coupled with reduced physiological arousal. Tremor variability 
predominantly correlated with negative emotional states, showing a negative 
association with valence scores and positive correlation with arousal levels. 
EEG analysis identified differential beta-band power modulation in prefrontal 
(Fp1/Fp2) and temporal (T3/T4) regions during negative emotion processing. These 
results suggest that emotion-driven tremor fluctuations in PD originate from 
dysfunctional integration of limbic and motor networks.
CONCLUSION: These findings establish emotion-modulated tremor as a distinct PD 
phenotype, informing the development of closed-loop biofeedback systems for 
personalized neuromodulation.

Reduced composite dietary antioxidant index increases the risk of Parkinson's 
disease and all-cause mortality in Parkinson's disease patients: evidence from 
the NHANES database.

Author information:

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the 
Composite Dietary Antioxidant Index (CDAI) and the prevalence of Parkinson's 
disease (PD), as well as to explore its relationship with all-cause mortality 
risk in PD patients.
METHODS: Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 
database spanning from 2007 to 2018 were used, including 119,609 participants. 
After excluding individuals aged <18 years, those with incomplete follow-up 
data, and those missing critical variables such as CDAI and covariates, the 
final cohort consisted of 34,133 participants. Participants were categorized 
into a PD group (510 individuals) and a non-PD group (33,623 individuals). The 
CDAI values were calculated, and participants were divided into three groups 
based on the tertile distribution of their CDAI scores: Q1 (CDAI < -1.07), Q2 
(-1.07 to 1.74), and Q3 (CDAI >1.74). Weighted logistic regression and weighted 
Cox regression analyses were employed to evaluate the associations between CDAI 
and the prevalence of PD, as well as between CDAI and all-cause mortality risk. 
Restricted cubic spline regression analysis was used to further elucidate the 
precise relationship between CDAI and outcome events.
RESULTS: CDAI values were significantly lower in the PD group compared to the 
non-PD group. After adjusting for age, sex, comorbid conditions (hypertension 
and diabetes), blood lipid and glucose levels, a reduction in CDAI was 
associated with an increased risk of PD (Q3 vs. Q1, OR = 0.72, p = 0.035). In 
patients with PD, a decrease in CDAI was significantly associated with a higher 
risk of all-cause mortality (Q3 vs. Q1, HR = 0.53, p = 0.018). This association 
was particularly pronounced in those over 60 years old, smokers, and those with 
hypertension. Restricted cubic spline regression analysis identified CDAI <0.471 
as a risk factor for PD, and CDAI <0.527 as a risk factor for all-cause 
mortality in PD patients.
CONCLUSION: CDAI reduction is an independent risk factor for both PD risk in the 
general population and all-cause mortality in PD patients, with amplified 
predictive power in older adults, smokers, and hypertensive individuals. Our 
findings support developing personalized antioxidant-enhancing nutritional 
interventions for both high-risk populations with suboptimal CDAI and 
established PD patients.

PURPOSE: Recent advancements in psycho-neuro-endocrine-immunology indicate that 
numerous noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) originate from disruptions in the 
cytokine immune network, resulting in chronic inflammatory responses. This 
persistent low-degree inflammation is attributed to deficiencies in crucial 
endogenous anti-inflammatory neuroendocrine systems, including the pineal gland, 
the endocannabinoid system, and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 / 
angiotensin 1-7 axis. The administration of pineal methoxyindoles (melatonin, 
5-methoxytryptamine), cannabinoids, and angiotensin 1-7 may entail potential 
therapeutic benefits for NCDs, particularly for patients who do not respond to 
conventional treatments.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of a 
neuroimmune regimen comprising melatonin (100 mg/day at night), 
5-methoxytryptamine (30 mg in the early afternoon), angiotensin 1-7 (0.5 mg 
twice daily), and cannabidiol (20 mg twice daily) in 306 patients with NCDs, 
including advanced cancer, autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, 
depression, and cardiovascular disease.
RESULTS: The neuroimmune regimen successfully halted cancer progression in 68% 
of cancer patients, who also reported improvements in mood, sleep, and relief 
from anxiety, pain, and fatigue. In patients with autoimmune diseases, the 
treatment effectively controlled the disease process, remarkable in cases of 
multiple sclerosis. Additionally, positive outcomes were observed in patients 
with Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and depression.
CONCLUSION: Randomized controlled trials are required to assess this therapeutic 
approach for NCDs that includes endogenous neuroendocrine molecules regulating 
immune responses in an anti-inflammatory manner.

BACKGROUND: Sex is a crucial determinant in the clinical manifestations of 
diseases. However, previous studies have not clarified whether altered brain 
morphology shows sex-specific patterns in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) 
with or without possible rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD). This 
study aimed to investigate sex-specific differences in the patterns of 
morphological changes among different subgroups of PD.
METHODS: High-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and clinical 
scale data were collected from 278 participants in the Parkinson's disease 
Progression Marker Initiative database: 93 patients with PD-pRBD (60 males, 33 
females), 114 patients showing PD without RBD (PDnon-pRBD group; 68 males, 46 
females), and 71 healthy controls (HCs; 44 males, 17 females). The Computational 
Anatomy Toolbox (CAT) 12 was utilized to collect data on gray matter volume 
(GMV) and cortical morphological metrics. Subsequently, individual-level 
morphological similarity networks were constructed on the basis of these 
cortical metrics. Finally, the topological properties of the network were 
analyzed using graph theoretical methods.
RESULTS: In the PD-pRBD group, the GMV in the frontal and temporal lobes of 
males was lower than that of females. In contrast, the gyrification index (GI) 
of the frontal lobe in males was lower than that in females within the 
PDnon-pRBD group. Network analyses based on graph theory revealed that male 
PD-pRBD patients showed lower network information integration than female 
patients, particularly in terms of the global properties of fractal dimension 
(FD) networks. Moreover, in the PD-pRBD group, male patients showed a strong 
correlation between morphological network metrics and cognitive performance, as 
measured by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) memory scores.
CONCLUSION: The presence of more significant sex-related differences in brain 
morphological changes in the PD-pRBD group in comparison with the PDnon-pRBD 
group highlights the importance of considering sex-related differences in the 
diagnosis and management of patients with PD-pRBD.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a significant global health challenge, affecting 
millions worldwide. This sub-study aims to explore the potential of ambulatory 
monitoring devices in identifying disease severity and progression in patients. 
As part of the MOMOPA-EC clinical trial, 156 patients with moderate to severe PD 
underwent 435 assessments using clinical scales and ambulatory monitoring 
devices (Parkinson's Holter). This sub-study seeks to establish relations 
between parameters derived from Holter monitors and clinical severity measures 
to enhance personalized disease management strategies.
METHODS: In the MOMOPA-EC trial, 435 patient monitoring sessions were conducted, 
during which patients wore Parkinson's Holter monitors for a week before 
completing clinical assessments, including the Unified Parkinson's Disease 
Rating Scale (UPDRS), Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), and Freezing 
of Gait Questionnaire (FoG-Q).
RESULTS: The reports obtained during the monitoring of the patients were 
classified into three groups based on the greater or lesser gait fluidity 
(according to the measurements from the Parkinson's Holter). All clinical scales 
were significantly different in each of these groups, indicating that patients 
with lower stride fluidity had poorer outcomes across the different clinical 
scales.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study underscore the potential of Parkinson's 
Holters in providing objective data for personalized disease management in PD 
patients. Integrating such technologies into routine clinical practice could 
enhance patient care and treatment strategies by offering clinicians objective 
insights into both disease progression and therapeutic response.

INTRODUCTION: Determining Parkinson's disease (PD) stage and severity are among 
the factors affecting treatment strategy. Dopamine transporter scan (DaTSCAN) 
has high efficiency in the diagnosis of PD, while its role in predicting motor 
function, dyskinesia, and symptoms severity trajectory remains controversial. 
This study aimed to evaluate the associations between motor symptoms patterns in 
PD with DaTscan findings.
METHODS: A total of 196 patients were included and grouped based on tremor 
score, postural instability and gait difficulty score, and the presentation of 
dyskinesia. Multivariate and ordinal logistic regression models were used to 
investigate the association between two-year follow-up of the PD patients' motor 
symptoms assessment scores and DaTSCAN finding patterns.
RESULTS: Patients with dyskinesia exhibited significantly lower DaTSCAN uptake 
across all measured regions, with the most pronounced reductions observed in the 
right caudate and left putamen (p < 0.001). Additionally, DaTSCAN values were 
strongly associated with overall disease severity (p < 0.001). A notable 
positive correlation was found between DaTSCAN uptake and Schwab and England 
Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scores, whereas significant negative 
correlations were observed between DaTSCAN measures (including the caudate, 
putamen, and anterior putamen) and clinical motor scores, such as MDS-UPDRS III, 
MDS-UPDRS II, and PIGD. In contrast, DaTSCAN parameters did not significantly 
predict tremor-dominant (TD) scores.
CONCLUSION: Beyond its diagnostic utility, DaTSCAN provides meaningful insights 
into disease severity and motor dysfunction in PD, with particular relevance to 
postural instability and gait disturbance.

OBJECTIVES: Patients with pre-existing Parkinson's disease (PD) face higher 
risks of severe acute COVID-19 outcomes than matched controls, but long-term 
post-COVID-19 outcomes remain largely unknown. This study investigated clinical 
outcomes up to 3.5 years post-infection in a Bronx inner-city PD population.
METHODS: This retrospective study evaluated 3512 patients with PD in the 
Montefiore Health System (January 2016-July 2023), which serves a large diverse 
population and was an epicenter of the early COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent 
infection surges. Comparisons were made with PD patients without a positive 
SARS-CoV-2 test (defined by polymerase chain reaction test). Outcomes were 
post-index date all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), 
altered mental status, fatigue, dyspnea, headache, psychosis, dementia, 
depression, anxiety, dysphagia, falls, and orthostatic hypotension. Changes in 
Levodopa prescriptions were also tabulated. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) were 
computed accounting for competing risks.
RESULTS: PD patients with COVID-19 had similar demographics but a higher 
prevalence of pre-existing comorbidities compared to PD patients without 
COVID-19. PD patients with COVID-19 had greater risk of mortality (aHR = 1.58 
[95% CI: 1.03, 2.41]), MACE (aHR = 1.57 [1.19, 2.07]), dyspnea, fatigue, and 
fall compared to PD patients without COVID-19. Levodopa dose adjustment was 
higher post-infection in the COVID-19 cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: Among PD patients, COVID-19 was associated with a higher risk of 
adverse long-term outcomes. PD patients who survive COVID-19 may benefit from 
heightened clinical awareness and close follow-up. Findings highlight the need 
to improve post-COVID care for PD patients to mitigate disease progression and 
maintain quality of life.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the burden experienced by family 
caregivers of individuals with dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 
Parkinson's disease (PD) in Bangladesh. It sought to identify the key 
contributing factors and determine the primary predictors influencing caregiver 
burden in this context.
METHODS: Seventy-five caregivers were selected on the basis of specific 
criteria. The Zarit burden interview was used to assess the caregiver burden 
among patients with dementia, AD and PD.
RESULTS: A total of 75 participants were assessed, with 50 (66.67%) being 
female. Most caregivers (40.0%) were spouses. Overall, caregivers experienced a 
moderate level of burden, with female caregivers reporting a higher burden 
compared to their male counterparts. Caregiver burden was significantly 
associated with age and the patient-caregiver relationship.
CONCLUSIONS: Greater research focus is needed on caregivers of patients with 
neurodegenerative diseases in developing countries.

L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA or Levodopa) is widely used to treat 
Parkinson's disease, but its large-scale chemical synthesis is costly and 
environmentally challenging. This study investigates the enzymatic conversion of 
L-tyrosine to L-Dopa to enhance efficiency and yield without any potential 
racemization. Tyrosinase, extracted from button mushrooms, was immobilized as 
cross-linked enzyme aggregates (TY CLEAs), achieving an activity of 
31.32 units/g. Commercially available skim milk served as a protein feeder and 
demonstrated antioxidant properties, helping prevent the formation of 
L-dopachrome as a byproduct by inhibiting the sequential oxidation of 
L-dopaquinone, along with ascorbic acid as a reducing agent. We evaluated the 
stability of TY CLEAs under varying temperatures, pH levels, and organic 
solvents. High productivity of 1210.95 mgL-1 h-1 was achieved using 10 units of 
enzyme at a substrate concentration of 15 mM with the use of a surfactant.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis involves astrocytic 
responses to extracellular amyloid beta deposits and phospho-tau neurofibrillary 
tangles, which drive inflammatory activation. RTP801, a stress-responsive 
protein, has been implicated in mediating neuroinflammation. Its levels are 
increased in AD hippocampal samples, correlating with disease severity and 
cognitive decline.
METHODS: Using astrocyte-specific RTP801 silencing in the hippocampus of 5xFAD 
mice, we evaluated cognition, neuroinflammation, and hippocampal connectivity by 
magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and resting-state functional connectivity 
analyses. Histological and biochemical analyses assessed microgliosis, 
astrogliosis, and inflammasome-related protein levels.
RESULTS: Astrocytic RTP801 silencing in 5xFAD mice preserved spatial memory, 
maintained hippocampal γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels, and preserved 
resting-state brain networks. In addition, RTP801 silencing significantly 
reduced markers of microgliosis, astrogliosis, and inflammasome effectors.
DISCUSSION: Astrocytic RTP801 contributes to AD-associated cognitive decline by 
disrupting GABAergic-regulated connectivity and amplifying inflammatory 
responses. Targeting astrocytic RTP801 may therefore offer therapeutic potential 
to mitigate AD progression by preserving neural connectivity and reducing 
neuroinflammation.
HIGHLIGHTS: The 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease presents higher levels 
of RTP801 in hippocampal astrocytes. Normalizing the levels of astrocytic RTP801 
prevents cognitive decline and restores anxiety-like behavior in the 5xFAD mouse 
model. Knocking down astrocytic RTP801 preserves the resting-state functional 
connectivity in the 5xFAD mouse model. Astrocytic RTP801 mediates the loss of 
Parvalbumin+ interneurons, negatively affecting the levels of γ-aminobutyric 
acid (GABA) in the 5xFAD mouse model. Astrocytic RTP801 contributes to astro- 
and microgliosis and inflammasome expression in the 5xFAD mouse model.

BACKGROUND: Scalp acupuncture is a promising potential therapy for neurological 
disorders. However, the development of its stimulation targets-both in 
identifying novel targets and refining the precision of their localization-has 
advanced slowly, largely due to the inadequate integration of brain science 
findings. This study leverages advances in brain neuroimaging to identify 
evidence-based cortical targets, enhancing the potential of scalp acupuncture 
and other brain stimulation techniques.
METHODS: Using the Neurosynth Compose platform, systematic meta-analyses of 
neuroimaging studies were conducted to identify potential surface cortical 
targets for ten neurological conditions: Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD), 
Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease 
(PD), Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), Post-Stroke Aphasia (PSA), Primary 
Progressive Aphasia (PPA), Dyslexia, Chronic Pain, and Disorders of 
Consciousness (DoC). These targets were projected onto the scalp, further 
localized using scalp acupuncture lines, traditional acupoints and EEG 10-20 
system.
RESULTS: We have identified specific cortical targets for scalp acupuncture 
associated with ten neurological disorders. Our findings are broadly consistent 
with current scalp acupuncture protocols while introducing additional new 
stimulation targets, such as the inferior temporal gyrus for memory processing 
and the angular gyrus for visuospatial attention. Additionally, the identified 
targets align with evidence from non-invasive brain stimulation, supporting 
therapeutic strategies for conditions such as movement disorders and cognitive 
impairments by targeting areas like the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and 
primary motor cortex.
CONCLUSION: Our findings provide a foundation for developing a brain 
imaging-based scalp acupuncture protocol for neurological disorders. The 
identified targets may also be used as brain stimulation targets for these 
disorders.

BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a promising role in ophthalmic 
imaging by providing innovative, non-invasive tools for the early detection of 
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's 
disease (PD). Since early diagnosis is crucial for slowing disease progression 
and improving patient outcomes, leveraging AI-assisted ophthalmic imaging 
retinal imaging can enhance detection accuracy and clinical decision-making.
METHODS: This review examines clinical applications of AI in identifying retinal 
biomarkers associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Relevant data was 
gathered through a comprehensive literature review using PubMed, ScienceDirect, 
and Google Scholar to evaluate studies utilizing AI algorithms for retinal 
imaging analysis, focusing on diagnostic performance, sensitivity, specificity, 
and clinical relevance.
RESULTS: AI-assisted ophthalmic imaging retinal imaging enhances the early 
identification of neurodegenerative diseases by detecting microscopic structural 
and vascular changes in the retina. Studies have demonstrated that AI models 
analyzing Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and fundus images achieve high 
diagnostic accuracy. Studies have reported an area under the curve (AUC) of up 
to 0.918 in PD detection, with sensitivity ranging from 80 to 100% and 
specificity up to 85%. Similarly, AI-assisted OCT angiography (OCT-A) analysis 
has successfully identified retinal vascular alterations in AD patients, 
correlating with cognitive decline and an AUC of 0.73-0.91. These findings 
highlight AI's potential to detect preclinical disease stages before significant 
neurological symptoms manifest.
DISCUSSION: The integration of AI technologies into ophthalmic imaging holds the 
potential to improve early diagnosis and transform patient outcomes. However, 
challenges such as model interpretability, dataset biases, and ethical 
considerations must be addressed to ensure the responsible integration of AI 
into clinical practice. Future research should focus on refining AI algorithms, 
integrating multimodal imaging techniques, and developing predictive biomarkers 
to optimize early intervention strategies for neurodegenerative diseases.

OBJECTIVES: Parkinson's disease (PD) often presents with neuropsychiatric 
symptoms that worsen quality of life. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
effectiveness of Botulinum neurotoxin-A (BTX-A) in managing neuropsychiatric 
manifestations in PD patients.
METHODS: Neuropsychiatric status was assessed in 185 PD patients using the 
Cornell Medical Index (CMI). Ninety-four patients exhibiting neuropsychiatric 
symptoms were randomly assigned to two groups: BTX-A (n=47, local injections) 
and citalopram (n=47, 10-40 mg/day). Outcomes were compared at baseline and 8 
weeks post-treatment.
RESULTS: The authors findings revealed a significant reduction in somatization, 
tension, anxiety, depression, sensitivity, and overall scores in the BTX-A group 
at the eight-week follow-up (p < 0.05 for all). Notably, patients in the BTX-A 
group exhibited similar levels of somatization, depression, anxiety, 
maladjustment, sensitivity, anger, and overall scores compared to the citalopram 
group (p > 0.05 for all). Both groups reported comparable percentages of 
improvement in neuropsychiatric symptoms (75.6% vs. 82.6%, p = 0.57).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the potential of BTX-A in alleviating 
tension, anxiety, depression, sensitivity, and other neuropsychiatric symptoms 
in PD patients. Importantly, BTX-A's efficacy was comparable to that of 
citalopram, suggesting its potential as a viable therapeutic option for managing 
neuropsychiatric manifestations in PD.

Anxiety and depression are common non-motor symptoms severely affecting the 
quality of life in patients with Parkinson's disease, but the underlying 
pathophysiological mechanisms remain elusive. As dopaminergic (DA) system and 
the subthalamic nucleus (STN) are involved in motor control and emotional 
processing, we herein investigated the role of DA circuitry in the STN in 
regulating depression in parkinsonian mice. A hemi-parkinsonian mouse model was 
established by injection of 6-OHDA into the right medial forebrain bundle (MFB), 
desipramine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) was injected 30 min before the intracranial 
injection. Motor function was monitored in open field test and 
apomorphine-induced contra-lesional rotation and rotarod tests; anxiety- and 
depression-like behaviors were assessed with the open field test, elevated plus 
maze, tail suspension test and forced swim test. We found that the 
hemi-parkinsonian mice displayed motor dysfunction and depression-like behaviors 
at different time points. Fiber photometry recording revealed that STN neurons 
were hypersensitive to anxiety- and depression-like stimulation; chemogenetic 
inhibition of STN neurons mitigated anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. 
While dopamine release was significantly reduced in the STN of the parkinsonian 
mice in response to anxiety- and depression-like stimulation, the expression of 
D1- and D2-like dopamine receptors was time-dependently changed. Intracranial 
injection of either D1- or D2-like dopamine receptor agonist into the STN 
mitigated anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in the parkinsonian mice. We 
conclude that STN DA circuitry may be promising targets to treat anxiety and 
depression in PD.

The accumulation of α-synuclein within Lewy bodies is a critical factor in the 
pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, with potential implications for axonal 
transport deficits. Activated asparagine endopeptidase enzymatically cleaves 
α-synuclein and tau, resulting in the formation of α-SynN103 and tauN368, which 
are markedly elevated in the brains with Parkinson's disease. In this study, 
rats received intrastriatal injections of 15 µg of preformed α-SynN103 and 
tauN368 fibrils, and their behaviors were evaluated after a 2-month period. 
Subsequent analyses investigated alterations in axonal transport and the 
underlying molecular mechanisms. Our findings indicated that preformed fibrils 
reduced kinesin levels and excessively activated the AMPK and p38 MAPK, thereby 
compromising the function of kinesin and dynein in axonal transport. 
Pharmacological inhibition of AMPK and p38 MAPK ameliorated these dysfunctions 
in rat models, which identified Compound C and SB203580 as potent inhibitors, 
offering evidence for early interventions of Parkinson's disease. Mechanisms by 
which PFFs caused axonal transport defects of dopamine neurons in PD-like 
models. (A) Shows normal axonal transport. (B) Demonstrates how PFFs increase 
?-Syn accumulation, reducing PIKE expression and triggering AMPK/p38 MAPK 
over-activation, which lowers kinesin levels and motor-cargo interaction. (C) 
AMPK activity inhibition with C.C significantly improves these deficits. (D) The 
p38 inhibitor enhances kinesin transport by preventing p38 MAPK over-activation, 
reducing its inhibition of kinesin-cargo binding.

Neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's 
disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) are major health threats for the 
aging population and their prevalences continue to rise with the increasing of 
life expectancy. Although progress has been made, there is still a lack of 
effective cures to date, and an in-depth understanding of the molecular and 
cellular mechanisms of these neurodegenerative diseases is imperative for drug 
development. Protein phosphorylation, regulated by protein kinases and protein 
phosphatases, participates in most cellular events, whereas aberrant 
phosphorylation manifests as a main cause of diseases. As evidenced by 
pharmacological and pathological studies, protein kinases are proven to be 
promising therapeutic targets for various diseases, such as cancers, central 
nervous system disorders, and cardiovascular diseases. The mechanisms of protein 
phosphatases in pathophysiology have been extensively reviewed, but a systematic 
summary of the role of protein kinases in the nervous system is lacking. Here, 
we focus on the involvement of protein kinases in neurodegenerative diseases, by 
summarizing the current knowledge on the major kinases and related regulatory 
signal transduction pathways implicated in diseases. We further discuss the role 
and complexity of kinase-kinase networks in the pathogenesis of 
neurodegenerative diseases, illustrate the advances of clinical applications of 
protein kinase inhibitors or novel kinase-targeted therapeutic strategies (such 
as antisense oligonucleotides and gene therapy) for effective prevention and 
early intervention.

Parkinson's disease causes a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons and iron 
accumulation in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Using ultra-high field 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 7 tesla in 43 Parkinson's patients and 24 
healthy controls, we analyzed the voxel-wise pattern of structural 
disintegration of dopamine neurons with neuromelanin-sensitive MRI, along with 
assessing iron accumulation using R2* and quantitative susceptibility mapping 
(QSM). We also explored correlations between these measures and the severity of 
residual motor symptoms in the on-medication state and other clinical variables. 
Differences were most notable in the nigrosomes within the pars compacta, with 
patients showing reduced neuromelanin signals and increased QSM values. Severity 
and asymmetry of motor symptoms correlated with higher R2* and QSM values in 
nigrosome N1. Thus, ultra-high field MRI provides high-resolution maps of 
various aspects of the underlying neurodegenerative process which reflect 
individual motor impairment in Parkinson's disease.

The dopamine transporter (DAT) is linked to neuropsychiatric disorders including 
ADHD, Parkinson's disease, and substance use disorders. Accordingly, DAT is the 
target of illicit drugs and clinically important medicines. However, the number 
and function of ligand binding sites in DAT is enigmatic due to conflicting data 
from available structures and molecular pharmacology. Herein, we design force 
sensors with DAT ligands and measure their interaction forces with wild-type and 
mutated DATs, from which two distinct populations of unbinding strengths and 
off-rates are detected. The high-force population is reduced by V152I and S422A 
mutations, or by substituting Na+ with K+ or NMDG+. In contrast, several 
modifications including mutation G386H, acetylation of K92 and K384, mutation 
K92A, mutation K384A, or protonation of H477 decrease the low-force population. 
The present data delineate the threshold of binding strength, which may account 
for certain ligand binding sites to be imperceptible in crystal or cryo-EM 
structures. Furthermore, the force spectra provide the information on the 
position and kinetic rates of a herein detected ligand binding site in DAT.

Long-term levodopa use in Parkinson's disease is associated with declining 
efficacy and motor complications. Understanding its effects on brain 
reorganisation is vital for optimizing therapy. Using data from Parkinson's 
Progression Marker Initiative, we investigated levodopa's impact on 
resting-state functional connectivity within the cortico-basal 
ganglia-cerebellum system in 29 patients, under drug-naïve and 
levodopa-medicated conditions. Univariate comparisons of inter-regional 
connectivity between conditions were conducted, and multivariate combinations of 
connections within and between networks were assessed. No significant effect of 
levodopa was found using the univariate seed-based approach. However, the 
network connectivity pattern between basal ganglia and cerebellum showed robust 
classification power. Eigenvector Centrality Mapping (ECM) further identified 
functional hubs, with cerebellar hubs being the only ones within the 
cortico-basal ganglia-cerebellum system affected by medication. Our study 
provides further insight into the importance of inter-network functional 
connectivity in Parkinson's and the impact of levodopa medication, highlighting 
the often-overlooked role of the cerebellum.

We previously demonstrated that kynurenine pathway (KP) dysregulation associates 
with Parkinson's disease (PD) and its symptoms. Here, we profiled 16 KP-related 
markers in a second, independent cohort; plasma: n = 202 (116 PD ("OFF"), 86 
controls); CSF: n = 183 (108, 75). Consistent with previous findings, we 
detected significantly higher concentrations of neurotoxic 3-hydroxykynurenine 
in plasma and lower concentrations of neuroprotective kynurenic acid along with 
higher neurotoxic quinolinic acid/kynurenic acid ratios in CSF of PD patients. 
Additionally, 10 markers showed sex-based differences, with more pronounced 
dysregulation in females. These 10 markers loaded to a single principal 
component linked to higher UPDRS I and II scores. Together, this suggests a 
composite signature of KP dysregulation in PD that is associated with worse 
symptoms and more prevalent in women. This work shows that KP dysregulation in 
peripheral and central compartments is linked to symptom severity in PD and 
warrants further systematic studies unraveling sex-dependent metabolic 
differences.

BACKGROUND: Delayed ON is a condition in which Parkinson's disease (PD) patients 
do not experience the effect of levodopa in time after taking the dosage. The 
efficacy of various oral levodopa regimens to overcome this problem has been 
investigated limitedly.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of levodopa/benserazide dispersible tablet 
in PD patients with delayed ON to first morning dose.
METHODS: This multicenter, randomized, cross-over trial involved 40 eligible PD 
patients with delayed ON. Participants were randomized to receive either 
levodopa/benserazide 100mg dispersible or regular tablets for 4 weeks, 
thereafter one week wash-out interval, followed by an alternate drug for another 
4-week. Participants took the investigational drug with the first-morning dose 
of their antiparkinsonian medications. Other medications were unchanged during 
the trial. The primary outcome was changes in time-to-ON after the first-morning 
dose recorded in a special diary before and after each therapy. We also 
evaluated changes in parkinsonism, motor fluctuations, and dyskinesia using the 
Unified PD Rating Scale and Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale. Finally, we 
investigated whether the efficacy wase affected by Helicobacter pylori status 
using baseline serum samples from every participant.
RESULTS: Nine patients dropped out during the trial. The time-to-ON was 
significantly reduced by the dispersible tablet compared with the regular tablet 
(-34.72 vs -23.81 minutes, p=0.014). There were no significant changes in 
parkinsonian severity or dyskinesia with either drug. The dispersible 
formulation was beneficial for both Helicobacter pylori-positive and -negative 
groups.
CONCLUSION: Levodopa/benserazide dispersible formulations can improve time-to-ON 
without exacerbating dyskinesia in PD patients suffering from delayed ON.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that commonly occurs in 
older individuals and clinically manifests as resting tremors, bradykinesia, 
muscle stiffness, and impaired postural balance. From a genetic perspective, 
animal models using gene-editing technologies offer distinct advantages in 
replicating the pathophysiological traits of PD, while also functionally 
exploring potential treatment targets. In this review, we highlight the 
available gene- modified animal models related to various mechanisms of PD, 
including abnormal expression of alpha-synuclein protein, dysfunction of the 
autophagy-lysosome system, abnormalities in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and 
mitochondrial dysfunction. We further discuss their respective strengths, 
limitations, and prospects, aiming to provide the most up to date information 
for the application of PD animal models and the advancement of anti-PD drugs.

INTRODUCTION: Previous research has shown that inflammatory immune biomarkers 
including peripheral white blood cell subpopulations differ between Parkinson's 
disease (PD) patients and healthy controls (HC), with PD exhibiting higher 
neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR). The aim of the present report was to 
assess the peripheral immune profile in patients or asymptomatic carriers 
harboring the p.A53T alpha-synuclein (SNCA) mutation.
METHODS: Data regarding 31 p.A53T SNCA PD patients, 9 asymptomatic mutation 
carriers and 194 HCs were obtained from the database of the Parkinson's 
Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). Focus was placed on peripheral immune 
blood cells subpopulations and clinical/imaging parameters at baseline.
RESULTS: NLR, Absolute Neutrophil cell count and Neutrophils to total Leukocytes 
ratio were increased in the p.A53T SNCA PD group as compared to HCs [2.77 vs 
2.18 (p < 0.001), 4.32 × 10^3 cells/μL vs 3.67 × 10^3 cells/μL (p = 0.001), 
65.67 % vs 59.55 % (p < 0.001)]. Differences in NLR were mainly driven by the 
male patient subgroup. Lymphocytes to total Leukocytes and Monocytes to total 
Leukocytes ratio were lower in the p.A53T SNCA cohort as compared to HC 
[(p = 0.001) and (p = 0.002)]. Finally, we observed a positive correlation 
between the absolute Lymphocyte count and the mean putamen DATSCAN signal. 
Asymptomatic carriers did not differ statistically from either group.
DISCUSSION: Our current study provides evidence of a specific pattern of 
peripheral immune response in the p.A53T SNCA PD group which aligns well with 
literature data in idiopathic and GBA-PD. Whether this peripheral immune 
activation represents a contributing cause or an effect of the neurodegenerative 
process will require further study.

OBJECTIVES: This study investigated post COVID-19 outcomes of patients with 
pre-existing neurological conditions up to 3.5 years post-infection.
METHODS: This retrospective study consisted of 1664 patients with COVID-19 (of 
which 1320 had been hospitalized for acute COVID-19) and 8985 non-COVID patients 
from the Montefiore Health System in the Bronx (Jan-2016 to Jul-2023). 
Pre-existing neurological conditions include dementia, mild cognitive 
impairment, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease. Primary outcomes were 
all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) 
post-COVID-19. Secondary outcomes were depression, anxiety, fatigue, headache, 
sleep disturbances, altered mental status, and dyspnea post-COVID-19. 
Multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was used to calculate adjusted 
hazard ratios for primary outcomes. Cumulative incidence function and Fine-Gray 
sub-distribution hazards model analysis were performed for secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: Patients with a pre-existing neurological disorders hospitalized for 
COVID-19 were more likely to die (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.90 [CI:1.57, 2.28], 
P < 0.005) whereas patients non-hospitalized for COVID-19 had similar mortality 
rate (aHR = 0.85 [CI:0.47, 1.54]. P = 0.59) compared to non-COVID patients. 
Patients with a neurological disorders (hospitalized for COVID-19 aHR = 1.76 
[CI:1.53, 2.03], P < 0.005; not hospitalized for COVID-19: aHR = 1.50 [CI:1.09, 
2.05], P = 0.01) were more likely to experience a MACE compared to non-COVID-19 
patients. Blacks (aHR = 1.49) and Hispanics (aHR = 1.35) had a higher risk of 
post-COVID-19 MACE. Both hospitalized and non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients 
were more likely to develop altered mental status, fatigue, sleep disturbance, 
dyspnea compared to non-COVID patients (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with pre-existing neurological conditions who contracted 
SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to have worse outcomes compared to controls after 
adjusting for major competing risks. Identifying at-risk individuals could 
enable more diligent follow-up.

PURPOSE: Individuals with neurodegenerative conditions, such as Parkinson's, 
Huntington's, Dementia, and Multiple Sclerosis, often experience significant 
social isolation due to physical and cognitive limitations that hinder social 
participation. Social isolation can lead to loneliness and reduced quality of 
life. This scoping review aimed to map interventions designed to enhance social 
connectedness and mitigate these effects.
METHODS: Following Arksey and O'Malley's scoping review framework, key databases 
were searched. Inclusion criteria focused on interventions fostering social 
participation in adults with neurodegenerative conditions. Themes were 
identified through a narrative synthesis approach.
RESULTS: A total of 1,038 articles were screened, with 37 meeting the inclusion 
criteria. Most interventions involved in-person group activities, with digital 
interventions representing a smaller area. The synthesis revealed three themes: 
intervention details, theoretical frameworks, and evaluations. These themes 
highlighted key components and theoretical foundations that informed 
interventions but also identified implementation challenges with accessibility 
and inclusivity for individuals with varied needs.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings underscore the need for diverse, accessible 
interventions to foster social connectedness for individuals with 
neurodegenerative conditions. Future research should focus on refining 
intervention design to improve inclusivity, addressing barriers to enhance 
participation in both in-person and digital formats.

Plain Language Summary: Neurodegenerative conditions increase social isolation, 
highlighting the need for targeted interventions to enhance quality of 
life.In-person interventions support social participation but must be adaptable 
for diverse needs.Digital options offer accessible ways to maintain social ties 
for those with limited mobility.Rehabilitation should focus on scalable, 
inclusive interventions that overcome participation barriers across disease 
stages.

Amyloid fibrils are characteristic features of many neurodegenerative diseases, 
including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. The use of small molecule 
ligands that bind to amyloid fibrils underpins both fundamental research aiming 
to better understand the pathology of neurodegenerative disease, and clinical 
research aiming to develop diagnostic tools for these diseases. To date, a large 
number of amyloid-binding ligands have been reported in the literature, 
predominantly targeting protein fibrils composed of amyloid-β (Aβ), tau, and 
α-synuclein (αSyn) fibrils. Fibrils formed by a particular protein can adopt a 
range of possible morphologies, but protein fibrils formed in vivo possess 
disease-specific morphologies, highlighting the need for morphology-specific 
amyloid-binding ligands. This review details the morphologies of Aβ, tau, and 
αSyn fibril polymorphs that have been reported as a result of structural work 
and describes a database of amyloid-binding ligands containing 4,288 binding 
measurements for 2,404 unique compounds targeting Aβ, tau, or αSyn fibrils.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative central nervous system disease 
pathologically attributed to dopaminergic neuron damage in the substantia nigra. 
Noscapine is a natural alkaloid with several benefits, including 
anti-inflammatory, neural protection, and anti-oxidant effects. Hence, the 
current study evaluated the protective effects of Noscapine against paraquat 
(PQ)-induced Parkinson's disease model in rats. Male Wistar rats were into six 
groups: sham and PQ-induced models treated with vehicle, vitamin-E (20 mg/kg/d), 
or Noscapine (6, 18, and 55 mg/kg/d) for four weeks. Meanwhile, the rats were 
assessed for weight and food consumption (FC) daily and PD-associated behavior 
changes using rotarod, bar, and parallel bar tests every week. The animals were 
ethically sacrificed at the end of the study, and biochemical, immunological, 
and histopathological markers were measured in the brain. As a result, the 
levels of weight, FC, parallel bar, and rotarod test (both speed and latency), 
number of neurons, total thiol content, and interleukin-10 (IL-10) were 
significantly reduced. In contrast, the levels of dark neurons, TNF-α, bar test, 
and malondialdehyde (MDA) were markedly increased in the PQ-vehicle group 
compared to the sham group (P < 0.001-0.5). In contrast, comedication with 
Noscapine significantly reversed the histological damages and improved 
deteriorated behavioral, biochemical, and immunological parameters in a 
dose-dependent manner compared to the PQ-vehicle group (0.001-0.05). Taken 
together, it was determined that using Noscapine has antiparkinsonian effects 
and improved behavioral tests, catalepsy, bradykinesia, and motor dysfunction 
and has a protective impact on the brain's neurons through its anti-oxidant and 
anti-inflammatory properties.

Rehabilitation exercises are critical for recovering from motor dysfunction 
caused by neurological conditions like stroke, back pain, Parkinson's disease, 
and spinal cord injuries. Traditionally, these exercises require constant 
monitoring by therapists, which is time-consuming and costly, often leading to 
therapist shortages. This paper introduces a deep learning model, convolutional 
neural network - squeeze excitation (CNN-SE), to automate rehabilitation 
exercise assessment. By optimizing its parameters with the grey wolf 
optimization algorithm, the model was fine-tuned for optimal performance. The 
model's effectiveness was tested on both healthy and unhealthy participants with 
motor dysfunction, providing a comprehensive evaluation of its capabilities. To 
interpret the model's decisions and understand its inner workings, we employed 
Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) to analyze feature importance at each time 
step. Our CNN-SE model achieved a state-of-the-art mean absolute deviation of 
0.127 on the KIMORE dataset and a comparable MAD of 0.014 on the UI-PRMD dataset 
across various exercises, demonstrating its potential to provide a 
cost-effective, efficient alternative to traditional therapist-led evaluations.

PURPOSE: Dopamine transporter (DAT) SPECT is an effective tool for early 
Parkinson's disease (PD) detection and heavily hampered by attenuation. 
Attenuation correction (AC) is the most important correction among other 
corrections. Transfer learning (TL) with fine-tuning (FT) a pre-trained model 
has shown potential in enhancing deep learning (DL)-based AC methods. In this 
study, we investigate leveraging realistic Monte Carlo (MC) simulation data to 
create a pre-trained model for TL-based AC (TLAC) to improve AC performance for 
DAT SPECT.
METHODS: A total number of 200 digital brain phantoms with realistic 
99mTc-TRODAT-1 distribution was used to generate realistic noisy SPECT 
projections using MC SIMIND program and an analytical projector. One hundred 
real clinical 99mTc-TRODAT-1 brain SPECT data were also retrospectively 
analyzed. All projections were reconstructed with and without CT-based 
attenuation correction (CTAC/NAC). A 3D conditional generative adversarial 
network (cGAN) was pre-trained using 200 pairs of simulated NAC and CTAC SPECT 
data. Subsequently, 8, 24, and 80 pairs of clinical NAC and CTAC DAT SPECT data 
were employed to fine-tune the pre-trained U-Net generator of cGAN (TLAC-MC). 
Comparisons were made against without FT (DLAC-MC), training on purely limited 
clinical data (DLAC-CLI), clinical data with data augmentation (DLAC-AUG), mixed 
MC and clinical data (DLAC-MIX), TL using analytical simulation data (TLAC-ANA), 
and Chang's AC (ChangAC). All datasets used for DL-based methods were split to 
7/8 for training and 1/8 for validation, and a 1-/2-/5-fold cross-validation 
were applied to test all 100 clinical datasets, depending on the numbers of 
clinical data used in the training model.
RESULTS: With 8 available clinical datasets, TLAC-MC achieved the best result in 
Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE) and Structural Similarity Index Measure 
(SSIM) (TLAC-MC; NMSE = 0.0143 ± 0.0082/SSIM = 0.9355 ± 0.0203), followed by 
DLAC-AUG, DLAC-MIX, TLAC-ANA, DLAC-CLI, DLAC-MC, ChangAC and NAC. Similar trends 
exist when increasing the number of clinical datasets. For TL-based AC methods, 
the fewer clinical datasets available for FT, the greater the improvement as 
compared to DLAC-CLI using the same number of clinical datasets for training. 
Joint histograms analysis and Bland-Altman plots of SBR results also demonstrate 
consistent findings.
CONCLUSION: TLAC is feasible for DAT SPECT with a pre-trained model generated 
purely based on simulation data. TLAC-MC demonstrates superior performance over 
other DL-based AC methods, particularly when limited clinical datasets are 
available. The closer the pre-training data is to the target domain, the better 
the performance of the TLAC model.

Myelination, the continuous ensheathment of neuronal axons, is a lifelong 
process in the nervous system that is essential for the precise, temporospatial 
conduction of action potentials between neurons. Myelin also provides 
intercellular metabolic support to axons. Even minor disruptions in the 
integrity of myelin can impair neural performance and increase susceptibility to 
neurological diseases. In fact, myelin degeneration is a well-known 
neuropathological condition that is associated with normal aging and several 
neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's 
disease. In the central nervous system, compact myelin sheaths are formed by 
fully mature oligodendrocytes. However, the entire oligodendrocyte lineage is 
susceptible to changes in the biological microenvironment and other risk factors 
that arise as the brain ages. In addition to their well-known role in action 
potential propagation, oligodendrocytes also provide intercellular metabolic 
support to axons by transferring energy metabolites and delivering exosomes. 
Therefore, myelin degeneration in the aging central nervous system is a 
significant contributor to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. 
Interventions that mitigate age-related myelin degeneration can improve 
neurological function in aging individuals. In this review, we investigate the 
changes in myelin that are associated with aging and their underlying 
mechanisms. We also discuss recent advances in understanding how myelin 
degeneration in the aging brain contributes to neurodegenerative diseases and 
explore the factors that can prevent, slow down, or even reverse age-related 
myelin degeneration. Future research will enhance our understanding of how 
reducing age-related myelin degeneration can be used as a therapeutic target for 
delaying or preventing neurodegenerative diseases.

In recent years, exosomes have garnered extensive attention as therapeutic 
agents and early diagnostic markers in neurodegenerative disease research. 
Exosomes are small and can effectively cross the blood-brain barrier, allowing 
them to target deep brain lesions. Recent studies have demonstrated that 
exosomes derived from different cell types may exert therapeutic effects by 
regulating the expression of various inflammatory cytokines, mRNAs, and 
disease-related proteins, thereby halting the progression of neurodegenerative 
diseases and exhibiting beneficial effects. However, exosomes are composed of 
lipid bilayer membranes and lack the ability to recognize specific target cells. 
This limitation can lead to side effects and toxicity when they interact with 
non-specific cells. Growing evidence suggests that surface-modified exosomes 
have enhanced targeting capabilities and can be used as targeted drug-delivery 
vehicles that show promising results in the treatment of neurodegenerative 
diseases. In this review, we provide an up-to-date overview of existing research 
aimed at devising approaches to modify exosomes and elucidating their 
therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative diseases. Our findings indicate that 
exosomes can efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier to facilitate drug 
delivery and can also serve as early diagnostic markers for neurodegenerative 
diseases. We introduce the strategies being used to enhance exosome targeting, 
including genetic engineering, chemical modifications (both covalent, such as 
click chemistry and metabolic engineering, and non-covalent, such as polyvalent 
electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, ligand-receptor binding, 
aptamer-based modifications, and the incorporation of CP05-anchored peptides), 
and nanomaterial modifications. Research into these strategies has confirmed 
that exosomes have significant therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative 
diseases. However, several challenges remain in the clinical application of 
exosomes. Improvements are needed in preparation, characterization, and 
optimization methods, as well as in reducing the adverse reactions associated 
with their use. Additionally, the range of applications and the safety of 
exosomes require further research and evaluation.

BACKGROUND: The mechanisms underlying respiratory function impairments in 
different motor subtypes of Parkinson's disease (PD) remain poorly understood.
OBJECTIVES: This study aims to elucidate the differences in respiratory function 
between the two main PD motor subtypes, tremor-dominant (TD) and postural 
instability gait difficulty (PIGD), and investigate their associations with 
disease severity.
METHODS: A total of 106 PD patients (59 TD and 47 PIGD) and 42 age- and 
sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled. Pulmonary function tests 
(PFTs), respiratory muscle strength, and respiratory drive measurements were 
conducted. Multivariate models were employed to analyze correlations between 
respiratory function indices and clinical characteristics.
RESULTS: Compared to HCs, PIGD patients exhibited significant reductions in 
forced vital capacity (FVC%) (P = 0.018), peak expiratory flow (PEF%) 
(P < 0.001), diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide adjusted for hemoglobin 
(DLCOc%) (P = 0.013), and total lung capacity (TLC%) (P = 0.045). Although 
differences between the two motor subtypes were not statistically significant, a 
more apparent declining trend was observed in PIGD patients. Regarding 
respiratory muscle strength, PIGD patients showed more severe impairments in 
maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax%) (P < 0.001) and maximal expiratory 
pressure (PEmax%) (P < 0.001). Multivariate linear regression analysis confirmed 
that PEF% was a significant determinant of cognitive function in TD patients 
(β = 0.497, P < 0.001), whereas the airway occlusion pressure at 100 
milliseconds (P0.1%) influenced cognitive levels in PIGD patients (β = -0.373, 
P = 0.015).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to TD patients, PIGD patients have more pronounced 
respiratory impairments. Specific respiratory indices correlate with motor 
severity and cognitive decline, highlighting their potential as markers for 
disease progression in PD motor subtypes.

Dystonia is a movement disorder with varied clinical features and diverse 
etiologies. Here we present a revision of the 2013 consensus definition and 
classification of dystonia in light of subsequent publications and experience 
with its application during the last decade. A panel of movement disorder 
specialists with expertise in dystonia reviewed the original document and 
proposed some revision. There was broad consensus to retain the definition of 
dystonia with only minor clarifications to the wording. Dystonia is defined as a 
movement disorder characterized by sustained or intermittent abnormal movements, 
postures, or both. Dystonic movements and postures are typically patterned and 
repetitive and may be tremulous or jerky. They are often initiated or worsened 
by voluntary action and frequently associated with overflow movements. The 
two-axis structure for classification of the many different presentations of 
dystonia was also retained, with some revision. Axis I summarizes key clinical 
characteristics of dystonia, including age at onset, family history, body 
distribution, temporal dimensions, phenomenology, and whether dystonia is 
isolated or combined with other neurological or medical problems. Axis II 
organizes information regarding its etiological basis, including genetic, 
acquired, and anatomical, and common disease mechanisms. This consensus provides 
an update to the original definition and classification of dystonia with the aim 
of facilitating its clinical recognition and management. The revision retains 
the essence of the original proposal and aims particularly to provide a 
structure facilitating a uniform implementation. © 2025 The Author(s). Movement

BACKGROUND: Device-aided therapies (DAT) offer alternatives to oral or 
transdermal dopaminergic treatments in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), where 
they can reduce motor fluctuations and dyskinesia and improve health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL). The 5-2-1 criteria can be seen as a rough indicator 
when DAT might be considered, that is, when a patient has daily ≥2 hours off 
and/or ≥1 hour troublesome dyskinesia despite ≥5 daily oral levodopa intakes.
OBJECTIVES: The objective was to analyze differences in HRQoL and clinical 
outcomes in patients fulfilling and not fulfilling the 5-2-1 criteria.
METHODS: Patients from three different regions in Sweden, registered in the 
National Parkinson's Disease Patient Registry (PARKreg), with registrations in 
off hours, dyskinesia hours, and Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-8 (PDQ-8) 
score were included. The generic QoL questionnaire EQ-5D was also evaluated. 
Data from PARKreg was complemented with data from a medical record review.
RESULTS: In total, 365 (36%) of 1085 patients with sufficient information met 
the 5-2-1 criteria. Patients meeting the criteria had a significantly lower 
HRQoL, as measured by PDQ-8 and EQ-5D, compared to those not meeting the 
criteria. Each additional hour spent in off or with dyskinesia was associated 
with lower HRQoL, where time in off state had the strongest impact.
CONCLUSIONS: The 5-2-1 criteria identified patients with high disease burden and 
poor QoL, in combination with motor fluctuations and/or dyskinesia. This 
delineates a group of patients for whom further investigation for DAT candidacy 
or other optimizations of treatments may be indicated.

BACKGROUND: The genetic landscape of pediatric cerebellar disorders (PCDs) in 
Finland is undefined.
OBJECTIVES: The objective was to define epidemiological, clinical, 
neuroradiological, and genetic characteristics of PCDs in Northern Finland.
METHODS: A longitudinal population-based cohort study of children with a 
movement disorder or a cerebellar malformation (diagnosis ≤16 years; study 
period 1970-2022) was performed in the tertiary catchment area of the Oulu 
University Hospital, Finland. The genotype-to-phenotype associations were 
compared with 1007 published cases with matching monogenic etiologies.
RESULTS: A total of 107 patients were included (cumulative incidence 21.9 per 
100,000 live births). A defined genetic or non-genetic etiology was identified 
for 59 patients. These etiologies were monogenic (66%), chromosomal (12%), or 
non-genetic (22%). Ataxia was the most common movement disorder. Friedreich's 
ataxia was uncommon, whereas ataxias belonging to the Finnish Disease Heritage 
were overrepresented. Forty-eight cases remained undefined. The diagnostic yield 
(ie, pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants) of next-generation sequencing 
(NGS) in ataxia was 65%. Common features were ataxia, developmental delay, 
seizures, hypotonia, and abnormality in brain MRI, whereas hearing loss, sensory 
neuropathy, and microcephalia were associated with fewer etiologies.
CONCLUSIONS: PCDs are a heterogeneous disease group with a high proportion of 
genetic etiologies. Age of onset and certain clinical findings may help 
distinguish between different disease entities. The diagnostic yield of NGS has 
increased over time. Our dataset will support clinicians to recognize PCDs, 
their co-morbidities, and genetic etiologies. Further data on epidemiology, 
shared disease mechanisms, and the natural history of PCDs will be critical for 
the development of treatment approaches. © 2025 International Parkinson and

BACKGROUND: Evaluation of movement disorders primarily relies on phenomenology. 
Despite refinements in diagnostic criteria, the accuracy remains suboptimal. 
Such a gap may be bridged by machine learning and video technology, which permit 
objective, quantitative, non-invasive motor analysis. Markerless automated 
video-analysis, namely Computer Vision, emerged as best suited for 
ecologically-valid assessment.
OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the application of Computer Vision for 
assessment, diagnosis, and monitoring of movement disorders.
METHODS: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses guidelines, we searched Cochrane, Embase, PubMed, and Scopus 
databases for articles published between 1984 and September 2024. We used the 
following search strategy: ("video analysis" OR "computer vision") AND 
("Parkinson's disease" OR "PD" OR "tremor" OR "dystonia" OR "parkinsonism" OR 
"progressive supranuclear palsy" OR "PSP" OR "multiple system atrophy" OR "MSA" 
OR "corticobasal syndrome" OR "CBS" OR "chorea" OR "ballism" OR "myoclonus" OR 
"Tourette's syndrome").
RESULTS: Out of 1099 identified studies, 61 met inclusion criteria, and 10 
additional studies were included based on authors' judgment. Parkinson's disease 
was the most investigated movement disorder, with gait as the prevalent motor 
task. OpenPose was the most used pose estimation software. Automated 
video-analysis consistently achieved diagnostic accuracies exceeding 80% across 
most movement disorders. For tremor, dystonia severity and tic detection, 
Computer Vision strongly aligned with accelerometery and clinical assessments.
CONCLUSIONS: Computer Vision holds potential to provide non-invasive 
quantification of presence and severity of movement disorders. Heterogeneity in 
video settings, software usage, and definition of standardized guidelines for 
videorecording are challenges to be addressed for real-word applications.

Orthostatic hypotension is frequently observed in patients with 
neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple system atrophy (MSA) and Parkinson's 
disease (PD). This study aimed to investigate the immediate effects of ankle 
plantar-dorsal flexion (APDF) exercises on hemodynamics and autonomic nerve 
function in patients with orthostatic hypotension. Thirteen consecutively 
admitted patients diagnosed with MSA or PD and orthostatic hypotension were 
included in this study. This crossover study included two consecutive, randomly 
assigned intervention sessions: one exercise session and one control session. In 
both sessions, patients sat relaxed in a chair for 6 min before standing up for 
5 min. During the exercise session, they performed APDF exercises at 60 
cycles/min during the final minute of sitting. Blood pressure and autonomic 
nerve function were monitored continuously. Correlations between patient 
characteristics and changes in SBP after standing (ΔSBP) were also analyzed. 
After 1 min of standing, SBP was reduced by a median value of 17.5 mmHg during 
the control session, while it lowered to only 1.0 mmHg during the exercise 
session. There were no significant changes in heart rate frequencies during both 
sessions. These results suggest that APDF exercises mitigate the drop in SBP 
through improved venous return, without affecting autonomic nerve function. We 
conclude that a short bout of ankle exercises may be an effective and safe 
intervention to prevent orthostatic hypotension in patients with 
neurodegenerative diseases.

BACKGROUND: Falls are a common challenge for people with Parkinson's disease 
(PwPD), driven by balance impairments and misaligned perceptions of balance 
abilities.
OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the replicability and generalizability of the 
relationship between balance ability and perception discordance and fall risk.
METHODS: Using baseline data from 2 clinical trials involving 171 PwPD, 
discordance was calculated using the Activities Specific Balance Confidence 
Scale and Timed Up and Go (TUG) or the Mini Balance Evaluation System's Test 
(MiniBEST).
RESULTS: Findings supported the replicability of discordance as a predictor of 
fall risk, with results consistent across measures. While TUG-derived 
discordance was statistically significant, MiniBEST-derived discordance showed 
generalizability without statistical inferiority.
CONCLUSION: These results emphasize the relevance of balance perception and its 
misalignment with ability as fall risk predictors.

The neuropathological process in Parkinson's disease (PD) and Lewy body 
disorders has been shown to extend well beyond the degeneration of the 
dopaminergic system, affecting other neuromodulatory systems in the brain which 
play crucial roles in the clinical expression and progression of these 
disorders. Here, we investigate the role of the macrostructural integrity of the 
nucleus basalis of Meynert (NbM), the main source of cholinergic input to the 
cerebral cortex, in cognitive function, clinical manifestation, and disease 
progression in non-demented subjects with PD and individuals with isolated REM 
sleep behaviour disorder (iRBD). Using structural MRI data from 393 early PD 
patients, 128 iRBD patients, and 186 controls from two longitudinal cohorts, we 
found significantly lower NbM grey matter volume in both PD (β=-12.56, p=0.003) 
and iRBD (β=-16.41, p=0.004) compared to controls. In PD, higher NbM volume was 
associated with better higher-order cognitive function (β=0.10, p=0.045), 
decreased non-motor (β=-0.66, p=0.026) and motor (β=-1.44, p=0.023) symptom 
burden, and lower risk of future conversion to dementia (Hazard ratio 
(HR)<0.400, p<0.004). Higher NbM volume in iRBD was associated with decreased 
future risk of phenoconversion to PD or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) 
(HR<0.490, p<0.016). However, despite similar NbM volume deficits to those seen 
in PD, associations between NbM structural deficits and current disease burden 
or clinical state were less pronounced in iRBD. These findings identify NbM 
volume as a potential biomarker with dual utility: predicting cognitive decline 
and disease progression in early PD, while also serving as an early indicator of 
phenoconversion risk in prodromal disease. The presence of structural deficits 
before clear clinical correlates in iRBD suggests complex compensatory 
mechanisms may initially mask cholinergic dysfunction, with subsequent failure 
of these mechanisms potentially contributing to clinical conversion.

BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that Parkinson's disease (PD) may originate 
in the gut and impact the central nervous system via the gut-brain axis, 
highlighting the significance of the gut microbiome. This study explores the 
neuroprotective potential of probiotics and their impact on CD163 expression in 
muscularis macrophages in a rat model of rotenone-induced PD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight rats were divided into six groups: control, 
vehicle control, and PD induced by rotenone consisting of positive control 
(rotenone only), a yeast probiotic group (25 mg/kg Saccharomyces boulardii), a 
bacterial probiotic group (10⁹/cfu/day probiotics mixture), and a combined 
yeast-bacterial probiotic group (25 mg/kg Saccharomyces boulardii, 10⁹/cfu/day 
probiotics mixture). We performed motor evaluations, tyrosine hydroxylase 
immunohistochemistry, stereological neuron counting in the hippocampus and 
cerebellum, and analyzed CD163 expression in muscularis macrophages via flow 
cytometry. The obtained data were statistically analyzed.
RESULTS: Rotenone-treated groups exhibited severe motor dysfunctions. Tyrosine 
hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the corpus striatum was lower in all 
rotenone-treated groups but it was higher in those with probiotic 
supplementation than in the positive control group. Rotenone caused degenerative 
changes in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, while probiotics demonstrated 
neuroprotective effects. CD163 expression in muscularis macrophages was 
significantly increased in the rotenone-treated groups compared to the control 
and vehicle control group.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that probiotics mitigate rotenone-induced 
neurodegeneration by preserving dopaminergic neurons and modulating gut-immune 
interactions. Determining the phenotypic characterization of muscularis 
macrophages is essential and their relationship with the microbiome may play 
significant role in neurodegenerative diseases.

The etiology of nervous system diseases is complicated, posing significant harm 
to patients and often resulting in poor prognoses. In recent years, the role of 
dopaminergic system in nervous system diseases has attracted much attention, and 
its complex regulatory mechanism and therapeutic potential have been gradually 
revealed. This paper reviews the role of dopaminergic neurons, the 
neurotransmitter dopamine, dopamine receptors and dopamine transporters in 
neurological diseases (including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and 
schizophrenia), with a view to further elucidating the disease mechanism and 
providing new insights and strategies for the treatment of neurological 
diseases.

According to theoretical studies, MRI signal decay due to transverse relaxation 
in brain tissue with magnetic inclusions (e.g., blood vessels and iron-rich 
cells) is expected to follow a transition from Gaussian behaviour at short echo 
times to exponential behaviour at longer times. The decay parameters carry 
information about the inclusions (e.g., size and volume fraction) and provide 
unique insights into brain microstructure. However, gradient-echo decays 
typically only capture the long-time exponential behaviour. We provide 
experimental evidence of nonexponential transverse relaxation decay in human 
subcortical grey matter from in vivo MRI data acquired at 3 T, allowing the 
subsequent characterization of the magnetic inclusions. Gradient-echo data were 
collected with short interecho spacings, minimal echo time (1.25 ms) and novel 
acquisition strategies to mitigate motion and cardiac-induced effects. The data 
were fitted using exponential and nonexponential models that describe the impact 
of magnetic inclusions on the MRI signal. Nonexponential models provided 
superior fits. The strongest deviations from exponential were detected in the 
substantia nigra and globus pallidus. Numerical simulations of the signal decay 
from histological maps of iron concentration in the substantia nigra replicated 
the experimental data, highlighting that non-haem iron can be at the source of 
the nonexponential decay. To investigate the potential of nonexponential decays 
to characterize brain microstructure, we estimated the properties of the 
underlying inclusions using two analytical models. Under the static dephasing 
regime, the magnetic susceptibility and volume fractions of the inclusions 
ranged between 1.8-4 and 0.02-0.04 ppm, respectively. Alternatively, under the 
diffusion narrowing regime, the typical inclusion size was ~2.4 μm. Both 
simulations and experimental data suggest an intermediate regime with a 
non-negligible effect of water diffusion. Nonexponential transverse relaxation 
decay allows to characterize the spatial distribution of magnetic material 
within subcortical tissue with increased specificity, with potential 
applications for Parkinson's disease and other pathologies.

INTRODUCTION: The decrease in overall range of motion (ROM) of the joints in 
Parkinson's disease (PD) contributes to a functional decline. Ankle dorsiflexion 
required for activities such as walking, climbing, and descending stairs can be 
a clinically important outcome in this population as well as the presence of 
freezing of gait (FOG). However, there are no studies that consider this 
analysis in PD.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and to compare the ankle dorsiflexion ROM in PD patients 
classified into freezers and non-freezers as well as PD patients and healthy 
subjects.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study based on assessment protocols with qualitative 
and quantitative measures. Thirty-four individuals with PD were enrolled in this 
study. FOG questionnaire was adopted to classify patients into FOG and non-FOG 
(NFOG). Daily L-Dopa consumption was evaluated. MiniBESTest was used to assess 
balance. Ankle mobility for dorsiflexion was assessed by closed kinetic chain.
RESULTS: Individuals with FOG had lower dorsiflexion ROM compared to individuals 
with NFOG (FOG - right ROM: 5.99 ± 3.48 cm; left ROM: 5.96 ± 3.42 cm; NFOG - 
right ROM: 8.90 ± 4.23 cm; left ROM: 8.83 ± 4.12 cm).
CONCLUSION: Individuals with mild to moderate PD with FOG and high L-Dopa 
consumption had lower ankle dorsiflexion ROM compared to NFOG individuals.

BACKGROUND: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) provides improvements in motor and 
non-motor symptoms in individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD). These 
improvements do not necessarily reflect better functioning, emotion, and less 
pain after DBS. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate individuals with 
PD perception regarding the effects of DBS in their functioning, emotion, and 
pain.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study which included individuals with PD who were 
submitted to DBS surgery. To assess the participants' perception, a 
questionnaire was developed using the Delphi technique, which was considered 
appropriate to use after 2 rounds of adequation, afterward being judged by 15 
specialists. The questionnaire has 13 questions related to the functioning, 
emotion and pain perception after DBS. Possible answers varied from 0 to 10, and 
the highest score corresponded to the better functioning, emotion, and less 
pain.
RESULTS: Fifty-one individuals, with a mean age of 60 ± 9 years, mean disease 
duration of 13 ± 4 years, and mean surgery time of 2.7 ± 1.4 years were 
included. The functioning, emotion, and pain perception of individuals with PD 
enhanced by 60% after DBS. Taking a shower without help was the item with the 
better improvement (9.3 SD1.9). Writing was the item that presented less 
improvement (6.6 SD3.3).
CONCLUSION: Individuals with PD who had DBS surgery accomplished a functioning, 
emotion, and pain improvement, with better enhancement in taking a shower 
without help and lower enhancement in writing.

BACKGROUND: Forward neck flexion (FNF) is a common postural abnormality in 
Parkinson's disease (PD), which disturbs the overall body alignment and can lead 
to more severe deformities through both central nervous system control and 
biomechanical compensation. The purpose of the current study was to investigate 
the biomechanical and viscoelastic properties of forward neck muscles related to 
FNF in individuals with PD, both with and without FNF, in comparison to 
age-matched individuals with normal posture.
METHODS: Hand-held myotonometry (Myoton Pro®) was conducted to determine the 
biomechanical and viscoelastic properties of the sternocleidomastoid and 
anterior scalene muscles of all thirty participants: individuals with PD and FNF 
(n = 10), individuals with PD without FNF (n = 10), and normal controls 
(n = 10).
RESULT: Individuals with PD, both with and without FNF, exhibited higher passive 
tone and muscle stiffness and lower elasticity, relaxation time, and creep in 
both muscles, particularly in the sternocleidomastoid, compared to age-matched 
normal controls. No significant differences in any muscle variables were found 
between the two PD groups.
CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that the biomechanical and viscoelastic 
properties of neck muscles are altered even in the presymptomatic stage of 
postural abnormalities in PD. This may provide potential evidence of underlying 
peripheral factors that involve postural deformities via proprioceptive 
disturbances and exacerbate rigidity in PD.

INTRODUCTION: Parkinson's disease (PD) is chronic and progressive, manifested by 
both motor and non-motor symptoms, such as anxiety. Anxiety occurs in more than 
50% of patients. Rehabilitation in PD is more focused on controlling motor 
symptoms. However, non-motor symptoms affect independence, functionality, and 
motivation.
PURPOSE: The present study aimed to compare the effects of immersive virtual 
reality (IVR) and non-immersive virtual reality (NIVR) training on anxiety and 
cognition in PD patients.
METHODS: Two VR devices were used: Nintendo Wii (NIVR) and Samsung Gear VR 
(IVR). A convenience sample of 60 participants was distributed into 3 groups: a 
no intervention control group (CG) and two training groups (IVR and NIVR). All 
were evaluated at the baseline (T1), 7 days after (T7), and 30 days after 
training (T30). The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Semantic Verbal Fluency test 
(VF), and Digits subtest in reverse order (DR) were evaluated. The intervention 
protocol consisted of 10 sessions, each lasting 1 h, twice a week, for 5 weeks. 
According to the motor and cognitive requirements of games, 4 games were 
selected for each VR system. The Friedman test was used for comparing groups at 
different times (P ≤ 0.05).
RESULTS: The findings revealed a significant decrease in the BAI score in the 
IVR group (F = 15 217; p < 0.001) between T1 and T7 (and between T1 and T30. No 
significant differences were found between T7 and T30. No significant 
differences were found for the cognition variables.
CONCLUSION: IVR is a useful and feasible tool for managing anxiety symptoms in 
patients with PD.

CONTEXT AND PURPOSE: Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by degeneration 
of dopaminergic neurons causing motor and non-motor changes that lead to reduced 
quality of life and functionality. Among the therapeutic strategies used, 
aquatic aerobic exercise has shown potential effects in stabilizing symptoms and 
disease progression. However, the development of exercise-based therapies 
requires an accurate prescription, and, in this regard, there are gaps in the 
literature. The purpose of this study was to examine the scientific literature 
on the prescription of aquatic aerobic exercises for individuals with PD, 
duration, types of exercises intervention, forms of intensity control and main 
outcomes analyzed assessed.
METHODS: This review was conducted based on PRISMA-ScR and was registered in the 
Open Science Framework. Studies published in the last 10 years were selected 
from the following databases: PubMed, PEDro, Sciencedirect and Web of Science. 
As inclusion criteria, studies that described aquatic aerobic exercise programs 
were selected. The study selection was conducted using the StArt platform, and 
data related to the types of exercises intervention, duration, intensity control 
and outcomes were extracted and analyzed.
RESULTS: In total, 1642 studies were identified and following the eligibility 
criteria, 9 studies were selected. The sample included 215 people with PD 
between stages 1-4 of the Hoehn Yahr scale.
CONCLUSION: There is currently no standardized prescription for aerobic 
training, therefore further studies are required.

INTRODUCTION: Individuals with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease may 
experience respiratory impairments. Exercise interventions can be prophylactic, 
reduce progression, and/or mitigate these problems, improving the patient's 
quality of life. This study aimed to analyze and compare the effect of two 
different combinations of multicomponent training on lung function, respiratory 
muscle strength, and aerobic capacity in individuals with Parkinson's disease.
METHODS: A randomized clinical trial was conducted. 13 people with a mild to 
moderate Parkinson's disease diagnosis were randomly assigned to two groups - 
group 1 (G1) undertook stretching, stationary bicycle, and strength exercises; 
and G2 undertook stretching, stationary bicycle exercises, inspiratory muscle 
training, and abdominal exercises. Both groups undertook two 60-min sessions of 
multicomponent training per week for 12 weeks. Maximal inspiratory pressure 
(MIP), maximal expiratory pressure (MEP), forced vital capacity, forced 
expiratory volume in 1 s, thoracoabdominal expansion, the 6-min walk test, and 
the five times sit-to-stand test were measured. The study was approved by the 
Human Research Ethics Committee, with the consent of all participants.
RESULTS: We observed effects on MIP and MEP over this time in both groups. Other 
variables did not present effects for time, group, or interaction.
CONCLUSION: 12 weeks of training with both combinations of multicomponent 
training increased respiratory muscle strength in individuals with mild to 
moderate Parkinson's disease.

The diagnosis and exploration of central nervous system (CNS) diseases remain 
challenging due to the blood-brain barrier (BBB), complex signaling pathways, 
and heterogeneous clinical manifestations. Neurons, as the core functional units 
of the CNS, play a pivotal role in CNS disease progression. Extracellular 
vesicles (EVs), capable of crossing the BBB, facilitate intercellular and 
cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) communication, making neuron-derived 
extracellular vesicles (NDEVs) a focal point of research. Recent studies reveal 
that NDEVs, carrying various bioactive substances, can exert either pathogenic 
or protective effects in numerous CNS diseases. Additionally, NDEVs show 
significant potential as biomarkers for CNS diseases. This review summarizes the 
emerging roles of NDEVs in CNS diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, 
depression, traumatic brain injury, schizophrenia, ischemic stroke, Parkinson's 
disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis. It aims to 
provide a novel perspective on developing therapeutic and diagnostic strategies 
for CNS diseases through the study of NDEVs.

Cognitive decline is a common non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), 
which can occur at any stage of the disease. However, the neural mechanisms of 
PD cognitive changes remain unclear. It has been reported that hemispheric 
asymmetry is associated with cognitive impairment. Thus, we aimed to explore the 
underlying mechanisms of PD subgroups with different degrees of cognitive 
progression by assessing functional interhemispheric coordination and their 
relations with cognition. Fifty-four PD patients including 29 stable cognitive 
performance (sPD) patients, 25 progressive cognitive impairment (pPD) patients, 
and 18 healthy controls (HC) were recruited in this study. All subjects 
underwent T1-weighted, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging 
scanning, and neuropsychological evaluations. Voxel-mirrored Homotopic 
Connectivity (VMHC) and voxel-based morphometry analysis were applied to detect 
functional interhemispheric coordination. Fisher z transformed VMHC (z-VMHC) 
value lower in the middle temporal gyrus (MTG), middle occipital gyrus (MOG), 
and superior temporal gyrus (STG) in the pPD group when compared to the sPD 
group. However, we did not detect the difference in gray matter volume among the 
three groups. Furthermore, the z-VMHC value of MTG and MOG was positively 
correlated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score of the follow-up. 
Therefore, z-VMHC values within the MTG, MOG, and STG appeared to be potential 
neuroimaging features to distinguish pPD patients from sPD groups. These 
findings may underlie the neural mechanisms of cognitive performance in PD.

The mitochondrial deubiquitinase ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) 30 negatively 
regulates PINK1-parkin-driven mitophagy. Whether enhanced mitochondrial quality 
control through inhibition of USP30 can protect dopaminergic neurons is 
currently being explored in a clinical trial for Parkinson's disease. However, 
the molecular basis for specific inhibition of USP30 by small molecules has 
remained elusive. Here we report the crystal structure of human USP30 in complex 
with a specific inhibitor, enabled by chimeric protein engineering. Our study 
uncovers how the inhibitor extends into a cryptic pocket facilitated by a 
compound-induced conformation of the USP30 switching loop. Our work underscores 
the potential of exploring induced pockets and conformational dynamics to obtain 
deubiquitinase inhibitors and identifies residues facilitating specific 
inhibition of USP30. More broadly, we delineate a conceptual framework for 
specific USP deubiquitinase inhibition based on a common ligandability hotspot 
in the Leu73 ubiquitin binding site and on diverse compound extensions. 
Collectively, our work establishes a generalizable chimeric protein-engineering 
strategy to aid deubiquitinase crystallization and enables structure-based drug 
design with relevance to neurodegeneration.

PURPOSE: To investigate the shared and distinct alterations in hippocampal 
subfield atrophy and functional connectivity (FC) in Parkinson's disease (PD) 
with normal cognition (PD-NC), PD with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and 
unspecified MCI (U-MCI).
METHODS: A total of 294 participants were included from two centers (30 PD-NC, 
86 PD-MCI, 76 U-MCI, and 102 healthy controls (HC)). Comparisons of hippocampal 
subfield volumes were conducted among groups. Seed-based FC was calculated to 
assess abnormalities between hippocampal subfields and cortical regions.
RESULTS: Compared to HC, PD-NC group showed volumetric reductions in the right 
cornu ammonis (CA) 2/3, granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus (GC-DG), and CA4 
subfields, while PD-MCI group exhibited bilateral volumetric reductions in the 
same subfields. PD-MCI patients exhibited increased FC between the bilateral 
GC-DG/CA4 subfield and the posterior default mode network (pDMN), as well as 
between the right GC-DG/CA4 subfield and the calcarine, in comparison to PD-NC. 
U‑MCI patients displayed smaller volume in the right CA4 compared to HC. 
Decreased FC of the hippocampus with the widespread visual network was observed 
in the PD-MCI group compared to the U‑MCI group.
CONCLUSIONS: PD-MCI is associated with structural vulnerability of hippocampal 
subfields in the CA2/3, GC-DG, and CA4 subfields, impacting FC with pDMN and 
visual network. Smaller scope of hippocampal subfields atrophy but weaker 
hippocampus-visual network FC abnormalities in U‑MCI relative to PD-MCI may 
suggest distinct progression mechanisms between these two conditions.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with disrupted neural activity in the 
substantia nigra, but its electrophysiological changes remain underexplored. 
This study investigates the oscillatory patterns of substantia nigra pars 
reticulata (SNr) in PD, compared to dystonia (DT). Intraoperative recordings of 
the SNr were obtained from 20 PD and 16 DT patients during DBS surgery. Spectral 
power, neuronal firing rate, beta burst dynamics, and correlation analysis of 
the SNr signal were analyzed. PD patients exhibited increased alpha and beta 
power, elevated firing rates, and reduced aperiodic exponent values in SNr 
compared to DT. PD beta bursts showed prolonged durations and fewer short 
bursts. Beta power negatively correlated with motor symptom improvement rates in 
PD but not in DT patients. These findings highlight pathological beta power in 
SNr of PD, which indicates that SNr-DBS may offer a future therapeutic avenue 
for PD.

Parkinson's disease (PD), a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, is linked to 
genetics and environment, but its mechanisms remain unclear. Emerging evidence 
connects purinergic signaling-particularly ATP-sensitive P2X7 receptor 
(P2X7R)-to PD. P2X7R expression is elevated in PD patients, and its antagonist 
BBG mitigates 6-OHDA-induced dopaminergic neuron death. This review discusses 
P2X7R's structure, neural functions, PD-related mechanisms, and therapeutic 
potential as a targert.

Smart devices can easily capture changes in voice, movements, and gait in people 
with Parkinson's disease (PD). We investigated whether smartphone-derived 
multimodal features combined with machine learning algorithms can aid in early 
PD identification. We recruited 496 participants, split into a training cohort 
(127 PD patients during "on" phase and 198 age-matched controls) and a test 
dataset (86 patients during "off" phase and 85 age-matched controls). 
Multidomain features from smartphone recordings were analyzed using machine 
learning classifiers with integration of a hyperparameter grid. Single-modality 
models for voice, hand movements, and gait showed diagnostic values of 0.88, 
0.74, and 0.81, respectively, with test dataset values of 0.80, 0.74, and 0.76. 
An integrated multimodal model using a support vector machine improved 
performance to 0.86 and achieved 0.82 for identifying early-stage PD during the 
"off" phase. A smartphone-based integrated multimodality model combining voice, 
hand movement, and gait shows promise for early PD identification.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by progressive degeneration of 
dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, while secondary parkinsonism (SP) 
may be due to drugs, vascular, infectious, inflammatory, or even paraneoplastic 
etiologies. There is currently no biomarker that accurately distinguishes SP 
from PD. Corneal confocal microscopy (CCM) identifies corneal nerve loss which 
is associated with motor, cognitive and autonomic dysfunction in PD patients. 
This study enrolled participants with PD (n = 45) and SP (n = 25). A subset of 
patients underwent L-6-18F-fluoro-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (18F-DOPA) positron 
emission tomography (PET) scan which showed bilateral decreased dopamine uptake 
in the putamen and caudate of patients with PD, but not in those with SP. 
Corneal nerve fiber density (CNFD) (P < 0.001) was lower and corneal nerve 
branch density (CNBD) (P = 0.007) was higher in the PD group compared to the SP 
group. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that 
combined CNFD and CNBD showed excellent discrimination between SP and PD, with 
an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.924. CCM may have clinical utility in 
differentiating patients with SP from PD.

While conventional deep brain stimulation (cDBS) treatment delivers continuous 
electrical stimuli, new adaptive DBS (aDBS) technology provides dynamic 
symptom-related stimulation. Research data are promising, and devices are 
already available, but are we ready for it? We asked leading DBS experts 
worldwide (n = 21) to discuss a research agenda for aDBS research in the near 
future to allow full adoption. A 5-point Likert scale questionnaire, along with 
a Delphi method, was employed. In the next 10 years, aDBS will be clinical 
routine, but research is needed to define which patients would benefit more from 
the treatment; second, implantation and programming procedures should be 
simplified to allow actual generalized adoption; third, new adaptive algorithms, 
and the integration of aDBS paradigm with new technologies, will improve control 
of more complex symptoms. Since the next years will be crucial for aDBS 
implementation, the research should focus on improving precision and making 
programming procedures more accessible.

We studied the age- and genetic-related prevalence of CSF alpha-Synuclein 
seeding and Alzheimer profiles in 188 samples from PD participants without GBA1 
variants (PDwildtype) and in 129 samples from PD participants with GBA1 variants 
(PDGBA1). While Alzheimer profiles increased with age in PDwildtype, it was 
sparse in PDGBA1. Alpha-Synuclein profiles remained stable with age in both 
cohorts. In PDwildtype, combined alpha-Synuclein/Alzheimer profiles were 
associated with earlier onset of cognitive impairment.

Neuropathology of Parkinson's Disease and Parkinsonism.

Parkinsonism, the clinical term for a disorder with prominent bradykinesia and 
variably associated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms, is virtually always 
accompanied by degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system, with 
neuronal loss and gliosis in the substantia nigra at autopsy. Neuronal loss is 
particularly marked in the ventrolateral cell groups of the substantia nigra, 
which project to the putamen via the nigrostriatal pathway. Parkinsonism is 
pathologically heterogeneous, with the most common pathologic substrates related 
to abnormalities in the presynaptic protein α-synuclein or the 
microtubule-binding protein tau. In idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), 
α-synuclein accumulates in neuronal perikarya (Lewy bodies) and neuronal 
processes (Lewy neurites). The disease process is multifocal and involves select 
central nervous system neurons, as well as neurons in the peripheral autonomic 
nervous system. The particular set of neurons affected determines nonmotor 
clinical presentations. Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is the other major 
α-synucleinopathy. It is also associated with autonomic dysfunction and in some 
cases with cerebellar signs. The hallmark histopathologic feature of MSA is an 
accumulation of α-synuclein within glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs). The most 
common of the Parkinsonian tauopathies is progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), 
which is clinically associated with severe postural instability leading to early 
falls. The tau pathology of PSP also affects both neurons and glia.

Active information gathering is a fundamental cognitive process that enables 
organisms to navigate uncertainty and make adaptive decisions. Here we 
synthesise current knowledge on the behavioural, neural, and computational 
mechanisms underlying information sampling in healthy people and across several 
brain disorders. The role of cortical and subcortical regions spanning limbic, 
insular, fronto-parietal, and striatal systems is considered, along with the 
contributions of key neurotransmitters involving norepinephrine, dopamine, and 
serotonin. We also examine how various clinical conditions, including 
schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and Parkinson's disease have an 
impact on information gathering behaviours. To account for the findings, we 
outline a neuroeconomic perspective on how the brain may evaluate the costs and 
benefits of acquiring information to resolve uncertainty. This work high- lights 
how active information gathering is a crucial brain process for adaptive 
behaviour in healthy individuals and how its breakdown is relevant to several 
psychiatric and neurological conditions. The findings have important implica- 
tions for developing novel computational assays as well as targeted interven- 
tions in brain disorders.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by dopaminergic neuron loss and resultant severe motor 
dysfunction. While current treatments primarily focus on maintaining dopamine 
levels, effective targeting of neuroinflammation, an important driver of disease 
progression, remains an unmet need. This study investigates the neuroprotective 
potential of BMDA (BMDA(N-benzyl-N-methyldecan-1-amine)), a natural compound 
derived from garlic with strong anti-inflammatory properties, using an MPTP 
(1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine)-induced mouse model of PD. 
Behavioral assessments, immunohistochemistry, and dopamine analysis showed that 
BMDA effectively reduced neuroinflammation and preserved dopaminergic neurons. 
In vitro studies showed that BMDA significantly suppressed inflammatory markers 
and reduced astrocyte activation in MPP+-induced primary cultured astrocytes, 
and real-time PCR confirmed that BMDA attenuated proinflammatory cytokines and 
chemokines. Further mechanistic studies showed that BMDA inhibited the p-p65 and 
p-ERK signaling pathways, which underlie astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation. 
These findings suggest that BMDA should be considered a therapeutic candidate 
for PD that targets neuroinflammation.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by 
degeneration and necrosis of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and 
decreased dopamine secretion in the striatum. Bile acids are important 
components of animal bile. In recent years, a variety of hydrophilic bile acids 
have been reported to have ameliorative effects in neurodegenerative diseases. 
Taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA) is one of the components of bile acid. 
However, whether TCDCA can treat PD and its specific mechanism is unclear. In 
this study, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine (MPTP)-induced PD model mice were 
constructed to investigate the effects of TCDCA on PD model mice and the impact 
of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. Concurrently, in vitro cell experiments 
utilized the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BV-2 microglial inflammation model 
to further investigate the effect and mechanism of TCDCA in inhibiting 
neuroinflammation. TCDCA effectively improved dyskinesia, attenuated 
dopaminergic neuronal damage in the substantia nigra and striatum, and inhibited 
α-Synuclein (α-Syn) expression in the substantia nigra of PD mice. TCDCA 
significantly inhibited microglia and astrocyte activation in the substantia 
nigra of PD mice, and decreased the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and 
protein expressions of inflammatory factors. In addition, TCDCA was found to 
inhibit nitric oxide (NO) release and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production 
in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglia. Furthermore, TCDCA suppressed the production of 
inflammatory factors, including interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis 
factor α (TNF-α), both in vivo and in vitro. Meanwhile, TCDCA significantly 
promoted Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) protein expression and 
inhibited the phosphorylation of serine/threonine kinase B (AKT), nuclear factor 
κB (NFκB) and inhibitor of NFκB (IκBα). TCDCA promoted autophagy in vivo and in 
vitro by increasing adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) 
phosphorylation, inhibiting mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 
phosphorylation, increasing LC3II/LC3I and Beclin1 expression, and decreasing 
P62 expression. Furthermore, TCDCA demonstrated mitochondrial protection by 
enhancing the expression of PTEN induced putative kinase 1 (Pink1) and Parkin. 
However, knockdown of TGR5 expression partially counteracted the inhibitory 
effect of TCDCA on LPS-treated BV-2 cells. Our results manifested that TCDCA 
activated autophagy and inhibited microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in 
experimental PD models probably through activation of TGR5 mediated AKT/NFκB, 
AMPK/mTOR and Pink1/Parkin signaling pathways.

BACKGROUND: Accessory pathway (AP) ablation is an established therapy for 
patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. An accurate 12-lead 
electrocardiogram (ECG) based identification of the AP location is crucial for 
an optimized risk assessment and ablation.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and validate a simplified 12-lead ECG 
algorithm for accurate localization of AP in WPW syndrome, to improve procedural 
risk assessment, ablation planning, and outcomes.
METHODS: In this multicenter study, 260 patients with a single manifest AP 
undergoing WPW ablation enrolled. The SMART-WPW algorithm was developed and 
prospectively tested and compared to established Pambrun and Arruda algorithms. 
The novel SMART-WPW algorithm allows for a stepwise localization of 12 ablation 
targets, which are displayed on a clock representation.
RESULTS: SMART-WPW algorithm correctly identified the AP in 253 of 260 patients 
(97%) (mean age 34±19 years; 51% female), with a sensitivity of 96%, specificity 
of 100%, PPV of 95%, and NPV of 100%. High accuracy was achieved for right-sided 
APs between 4-8 o'clock (100% sensitivity and specificity) and for left-sided 
APs between 5-8 o'clock (100% sensitivity and specificity). The SMART-WPW 
algorithm outperformed the Pambrun (97% vs. 90%, p=0.015) and Arruda algorithms 
(97% vs. 73%, p<0.001). In a subgroup of children under 18 (n=76; mean age 14±3 
years; 61% female), the algorithm showed higher accuracy than the Arruda 
algorithm (97% vs. 62%, p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: The SMART-WPW algorithm is an accurate, efficient, and reproducible 
tool for 12-lead ECG-based AP localization. Its use may enhance preprocedural 
assessment and ablation planning in WPW syndrome.

Protein misfolding and aggregation play a central role in the progression of 
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. These aggregates 
manifest either as structured amyloid fibrils enriched in β-sheet conformations 
or as irregular amorphous aggregates with diverse morphologies. Understanding 
their formation, structure, and behavior is critical for deciphering disease 
mechanisms and developing targeted diagnostics and therapeutics. This review 
presents an integrated overview of both conventional and advanced techniques 
used to detect, distinguish, and structurally characterize these protein 
aggregates. It covers a range of spectroscopic and spectrometric tools, such as 
fluorescence, Raman, and mass spectrometry that facilitate aggregate 
identification. Microscopy methods, including atomic force and electron 
microscopy, are highlighted for morphological analysis. The review also 
discusses in situ detection strategies using fluorescent dyes, 
conformation-specific antibodies, enzymatic reporters, and real-time imaging. 
Separation methods like centrifugation, electrophoresis, and chromatography are 
outlined alongside structural analysis tools such as X-ray diffraction. 
Furthermore, the growing utility of computational approaches and artificial 
intelligence in predicting aggregation propensities and integrating biological 
data is emphasized. By critically evaluating each method's capabilities and 
limitations, this review provides a practical and forward-looking resource for 
researchers studying the complex landscape of protein aggregation.

BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a prevalent and debilitating symptom in many chronic 
conditions, including immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) and 
neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). Fatigue often fluctuates significantly within 
and between days, yet traditional patient-reported outcomes (PROs) typically 
rely on recall periods of a week or more, potentially missing these short-term 
variations. The development of digital tools, such as electronic diaries 
(eDiaries), offers a unique opportunity to collect granular, real-time data. 
However, the feasibility, adherence, and comparability of eDiary-based 
assessments to established PROs require further investigation.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of 
using a high-frequency eDiary to capture intraday variability in fatigue and to 
compare eDiary data with scores obtained from the Functional Assessment of 
Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F), a validated weekly recall PRO.
METHODS: Data were collected from 159 participants enrolled in the IDEA-FAST 
(Identifying Digital Endpoints to Assess Fatigue, Sleep and Activities in Daily 
Living in Neurodegenerative Disorders and Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases) 
feasibility study; a 4-week prospective observational study conducted at 4 
European centers. Participants included individuals with NDDs (n=39), IMIDs 
(n=78), and healthy volunteers (n=42). Participants used an eDiary to report 
their physical and mental fatigue levels up to 4 times daily on a 7-point Likert 
scale (0=low and 6=high). Adherence was calculated as the proportion of 
completed eDiary entries relative to the total expected entries. Correlations 
between averaged eDiary scores and weekly FACIT-F scores were analyzed.
RESULTS: Adherence to the eDiary protocol was 5505/8880 (61.99%) overall, 
varying by cohort, with the highest adherence (1117/1200, 93.07%) observed in 
the primary Sjögren syndrome cohort and the lowest adherence in the Parkinson 
disease (410/960, 42.7%) and Huntington disease (320/720, 44.4%) cohorts. The 
average adherence was 430/1680 (43.45%) in the NDD cohorts and 3367/4560 
(73.84%) in the IMID cohorts. Fatigue levels showed clear diurnal variation, 
with significantly higher fatigue reported in the evening compared to the 
morning (P<.001). A moderate correlation (Spearman=0.46, P<.001) was observed 
between eDiary fatigue scores and FACIT-F scores, with stronger cohort-specific 
associations for certain FACIT-F items. These results indicate that eDiaries 
provide complementary insights to weekly PROs by capturing intraday fluctuations 
in fatigue.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility, acceptability, and 
validity of using high-frequency eDiaries to assess fatigue in chronic 
conditions. By effectively detecting intra- and interday fatigue variations, 
eDiaries complement traditional PROs such as FACIT-F, offering a more nuanced 
understanding of fatigue patterns. Future research should explore optimized 
eDiary protocols to balance participant burden with data granularity.

PURPOSE: Providing care for family members with neurodegenerative diseases 
entails significant physical and psychosocial costs, increasing caregiver 
burden. Limited research exists on the factors contributing to dysphagia-related 
burden, particularly across disease trajectories. This study aimed to (a) 
determine if dysphagia-related burden predicts general caregiver burden, (b) 
identify predictors of dysphagia-related burden, and (c) examine relationships 
between dysphagia severity, disease severity, and dysphagia-related burden.
METHOD: Care partners (N = 211; 80% female; Mage = 60 ± 14 years) from clinics 
in Canada, New Zealand, and the United States participated. Care recipients 
included those with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; n = 48), dementia (n = 
110), and Parkinson's disease (PD; n = 53). General burden was measured using 
the Zarit Burden Interview, while dysphagia-related burden was assessed via the 
Caregiver Assessment of Reported Experiences with Swallowing Difficulties. 
Multiple regression analyses examined predictors of general and 
dysphagia-related burden and their relationships to dysphagia and disease 
severity.
RESULTS: Higher general burden was associated with female caregivers (β = -.19, 
p = .05), higher education (β = .16, p = .03), caring for someone with dementia 
(β = .36, p = .01), and greater dysphagia-related burden (β = .33, p = .01). 
Predictors of dysphagia-related burden included working caregivers (β = .15, p = 
.01), increased dysphagia symptoms (β = .77, p < .01), and caring for 
individuals with ALS or dementia (vs. PD; β = -.16, p = .02). Dysphagia burden 
varied by disease severity and diet tolerance (p < .01).
CONCLUSIONS: Managing dysphagia independently contributes to caregiver burden, 
potentially increasing burnout and nonadherence to clinical recommendations. 
Early, proactive inquiry about dysphagia-related care partner burden and 
provision of support to minimize burden should be considered early in disease 
management.

A Novel Dynamic Latent Variables-Based Framework for Enhancing Freezing of Gait 
Detection in Parkinson's Disease Patients.

Wang X, Yu L, Qin SJ, Zhao Y.

Freezing of Gait (FOG) is one of the most severe symptoms of Parkinson's disease 
(PD), which often lead to life-threatening falls. Wearable sensor-based 
technologies coupled with data driven methods have advanced the detection of FOG 
in a timely fashion. However, most existing monitoring methods overlook the 
dynamics of processes when extracting effective information from 
high-dimensional sensor data. To tackle these problems, we develop a novel 
framework for FOG detection by integrating Dynamic Latent Variable (DLV)-based 
dimensionality reduction strategies and personalized monitoring. First, a 
multi-channel sliding window mechanism is adopted to extract the multiple 
potentially effective feature sequences. Second, an interpretable DLV-based 
method incorporating time-lagged terms is designed for the subspace 
representation of complex high-dimensional sequences. Third, the extracted DLVs 
are integrated with threshold-based methods or the Statistical Process Control 
(SPC) method for anomaly detection. We identified distinct variations in gait 
patterns among individuals, underscoring the importance of personalized 
approaches. The proposed framework demonstrates its effectiveness in FOG 
detection via validating on real world dataset, achieving a sensitivity of 
$\mathbf {0.845} \pm \mathbf {0.254}$ and a specificity of $\mathbf {0.842} \pm 
\mathbf {0.211}$.

Dopamine transporter (DAT) is closely associated with neurodegenerative diseases 
such as Parkinson's disease (PD). To develop an in vivo stable radioligand 
targeting DAT, we synthesized a novel iodine-131-labeled tropane analog [131I]1 
with deuteration on both the N-fluoropropyl and 2β-carbomethoxy positions of the 
tropane scaffold and then biologically compared with the previously reported 
analog [131I]FP-CIT-d6 with deuteration only on the N-fluoropropyl group. The 
radioligand [131I]1 was obtained via a radioiodine-destannylation reaction with 
a radiochemical yield of ~95%, a radiochemical purity of > 99% and a molar 
activity of 12.72 GBq/μmol. [131I]1 exhibited a high in vitro binding affinity 
for DAT with an IC50 value of 2.2 nM. Metabolic stability studies demonstrated 
that [131I]1 displayed superior in vivo stability compared with [131I]FP-CIT-d6. 
Biodistribution studies revealed that [131I]1 had better DAT affinity, 
specificity, and a higher target-to-background ratio than [131I]FP-CIT-d6. 
Ex vivo autoradiography and blocking experiments validated the selective and 
reversible binding of [131I]1 to DAT and superiority to [131I]FP-CIT-d6. These 
preliminary results suggest that deuterated radioligand [131I]1, with enhanced 
in vivo stability and higher target-to-background ratio, is a promising DAT 
probe, warranting the development and application of 123I-labeled counterpart 
([123I]1) for SPECT imaging in DAT-related disorders.

Neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and 
stroke pose significant challenges for conventional therapy due to the 
complexities of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the restricted delivery of 
drugs to the central nervous system. Exosomes, a type of small extracellular 
vesicle secreted by nearly all cell types, hold substantial promise as delivery 
vehicles for therapeutic agents in treating these conditions. Notably, stem 
cell-secreted exosomes have emerged as particularly effective due to their 
regenerative potential and natural ability to cross the BBB. Similarly, 
hydrogels have gained recognition as versatile biomaterials capable of 
supporting sustained release and targeted delivery of therapeutics. The 
combination of the regenerative properties of stem cell-derived exosomes 
(SC-Exos) with the structural and functional benefits of hydrogels offers a 
promising approach for enhancing neurogenesis, modulating neuroinflammation, and 
facilitating tissue repair. This review explores the origin, structure, and 
modifications of exosomes as well as the synthesis and incorporation methods of 
hydrogels in the therapeutic context for debilitating neurological disorders. It 
highlights recent advancements in using SC-Exos and hydrogels for therapeutic 
delivery, addressing both current challenges and future applications. Improving 
our understanding of hydrogels loaded with SC-Exos for cargo transportation and 
neural tissue regeneration may pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies.

BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes is considered a critical challenge to modern 
healthcare systems. The National Health Service Diabetes Prevention Programme 
delivered an evidence-based behaviour change programme at a national scale to 
reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes in England.
OBJECTIVE(S): The Diabetes Prevention - Long-term Multimethod Assessment 
research programme provided a comprehensive assessment of the delivery of the 
National Health Service Diabetes Prevention Programme and its effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness.
DESIGN: Mixed-methods research including qualitative methods, observations, 
patient surveys and secondary analysis of administrative and survey data using 
statistical and econometric methods.
SETTING: Community settings in England delivering the commissioned intervention, 
supported by general practices responsible for recruitment and referral.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients in community settings identified as being at high risk of 
type 2 diabetes offered and participating in the National Health Service 
Diabetes Prevention Programme, and staff involved in the organisation and 
delivery of the service.
INTERVENTIONS: The National Health Service Diabetes Prevention Programme, 
including its evidence-based behaviour change intervention (using both 
face-to-face and digital platforms) and the associated services for patient 
recruitment.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of type 2 diabetes, cost-effectiveness, access 
to the programme and fidelity of intervention delivery.
DATA SOURCES: Interviews with patients and staff, document analysis and 
observations of the National Health Service Diabetes Prevention Programme 
delivery, patient surveys, secondary data (including National Health Service 
Diabetes Prevention Programme data, national surveys and audits).
RESULTS: The National Health Service Diabetes Prevention Programme was 
associated with significant reductions in incidence of type 2 diabetes and was 
highly likely to be cost-effective. Analyses of the delivery of the programme 
highlighted several aspects which impacted access to the programme and the 
fidelity with which the behaviour change intervention was delivered. For 
example, uptake and adherence were influenced by participants' psychosocial 
beliefs (e.g. chance of getting type 2 diabetes and whether taking part would 
reduce this). There were large differences between general practices in how many 
people they referred to the programme, with practices that offered 
higher-quality care for people with diabetes referring more. Variation in 
retention and outcomes was associated with differences in providers.
LIMITATIONS: Analysis of administrative data to explore effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness may be influenced by confounding. Recruitment of diverse and 
representative samples for surveys, interviews and observations was likely 
impacted by selection.
CONCLUSIONS: The National Health Service Diabetes Prevention Programme is highly 
likely to be cost-effective. Data from Diabetes Prevention - Long-term 
Multimethod Assessment have been used to improve aspects of programme delivery 
and could suggest further enhancements to improve recruitment, retention and 
fidelity.
FUTURE WORK: Future research should address the question of whether the National 
Health Service Diabetes Prevention Programme prevents or delays type 2 diabetes 
when longer-term follow-up data are available. We identified factors that could 
be targeted to impact on recruitment, retention and inequalities, and recommend 
a robust assessment of the link between fidelity and outcomes.
FUNDING: This synopsis presents independent research funded by the National 
Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Health and Social Care Delivery 
Research programme as award number 16/48/07.

Plain Language Summary: The National Health Service Diabetes Prevention 
Programme was launched in 2016 to reduce the number of people getting type 2 
diabetes. This 9-month course offers support to improve diet and exercise to 
people at high risk of type 2 diabetes. An online course was also offered from 
2019. The Diabetes Prevention – Long-term Multimethod Assessment research 
programme tested whether the National Health Service Diabetes Prevention 
Programme works better than usual National Health Service care for reducing 
risk, and whether the National Health Service Diabetes Prevention Programme 
provides value for money. The research also studied who joins, what makes people 
take part, how the course is delivered, and what benefits are achieved. We: did 
interviews with participants, staff, course providers, and National Health 
Service Diabetes Prevention Programme leaders ran surveys and observed courses 
across England analysed data from national surveys, general practitioner records 
and the programme providers shared results with National Health Service England 
to help them make improvements. We found: Decisions to join were influenced by 
individuals’ personal views of their chance of getting type 2 diabetes and 
whether taking part would reduce this. There were large differences between 
general practices in how many people they referred to the programme, with 
practices that offered higher-quality care for people with diabetes referring 
more. Levels of participation in the course and the benefits participants 
achieved varied. There were differences between populations in rates of joining 
and completing the programme. For instance, younger adults and people in areas 
of higher deprivation were less likely to join. People from ethnic minorities 
were more likely to join but were less likely to complete the course. The 
programme reduced cases of type 2 diabetes, at a cost that offered value for 
money. Overall, we found the National Health Service Diabetes Prevention 
Programme is achieving positive results, but there are opportunities to make it 
better in future.

Oligodendroglia are the responsible cells for myelination in the central nervous 
system and their involvement in Parkinson's disease (PD) is poorly understood. 
We performed sn-RNA-seq and image-based spatial transcriptomics of human caudate 
nucleus and putamen (dorsal striatum) from PD and control brain donors to 
elucidate the diversity of oligodendroglia and how they are affected by the 
disease. We profiled a total of ~ 200.000 oligodendroglial nuclei, defining 15 
subclasses, from precursor to mature cells, 4 of which are disease-associated. 
These PD-specific populations are characterized by the overexpression of heat 
shock proteins, as well as distinct expression signatures related to immune 
responses, myelination alterations, and disrupted cell signaling pathways. We 
have also identified impairments in cell communication and oligodendrocyte 
development, evidenced by changes in neurotransmitter receptors expression and 
cell adhesion molecules. In addition, we observed significant disruptions in 
oligodendrocyte development, with aberrant differentiation trajectories and 
shifts in cell proportions, particularly in the transition from mature 
oligodendrocytes to disease-associated states. Quantitative immunohistochemical 
analysis revealed decreased myelin levels in the PD striatum, which correlated 
with transcriptomic alterations. Furthermore, spatial transcriptomics mapping 
revealed the distinct localization of disease-associated populations within the 
striatum, with evidence of impaired myelin integrity. Thus, we uncover 
oligodendroglia as a critical cell type in PD and a potential new therapeutic 
target for myelin-based interventions.

Campus, Hinxton, Cambridgeshire CB10 1SD, United Kingdom.

SUMMARY: The Ontology Lookup Service (OLS) is an open source search engine for 
ontologies which is used extensively in the bioinformatics and chemistry 
communities to annotate biological and biomedical data with ontology terms. 
Recently there has been a significant increase in the size and complexity of 
ontologies due to new scales of biological knowledge, such as spatial 
transcriptomics, new ontology development methodologies, and curation on an 
increased scale. Existing Web-based tools for ontology browsing such as 
BioPortal and OntoBee do not support the full range of definitions used by 
today's ontologies. In order to support the community going forward, we have 
developed OLS4, implementing the complete OWL2 specification, 
internationalization support for multiple languages, and a new user interface 
with UX enhancements such as links out to external databases. OLS4 has replaced 
OLS3 in production at EMBL-EBI and has a backwards compatible API supporting 
users of OLS3 to transition.
AVAILABILITY: The source code of OLS is available at 
https://github.com/EBISPOT/ols4 and DOI 10.5281/zenodo.14960290 with Apache 2.0

IMPLEMENTATION: A freely available implementation is accessible at

Differential Effects of Visual and Auditory Cognitive Tasks on Smooth Pursuit 
Eye Movements.

Smooth pursuit eye movements (SPEM) are important to gather visual information 
that guides our interactions with moving objects (e.g., tracking a tennis ball, 
or following a car when driving). In many neurological conditions, from 
Parkinson's disease to stroke, the voluntary control of SPEM can be compromised. 
Therefore, SPEMs can serve as sensitive proxies for assessing cognitive and 
sensorimotor function. Prior research has shown that SPEMs are influenced by 
attention and working memory load, yet it remains unclear how the sensory 
modality of concurrent tasks interacts with these effects. Here, we conducted a 
3 (working memory load: no load, easy [low load], and hard [high load]) × 2 
(sensory modality: visual vs. auditory) experiment to examine how working memory 
load and secondary task modality interact to affect SPEM in healthy young 
adults. Participants tracked a moving circle while simultaneously performing an 
arithmetic task, where they added either constant (1) or variable (1-5) numbers 
which were presented visually or auditorily. Our results showed that a secondary 
auditory task increased tracking variability during high cognitive load. In 
contrast, we found that the visual task improved tracking, reducing variability 
irrespective of cognitive load. We interpret our results as evidence that 
auditory processing requires additional top-down control that is critical for 
the control of smooth pursuit, diverting resources required for smooth pursuit 
and, consequently, increasing SPEM variability. These findings emphasize the 
importance of sensory modality in understanding the interactions between working 
memory and oculomotor control. We suggest that auditory secondary cognitive 
tasks may provide a more sensitive test of sensorimotor control deficits in 
future research with clinical populations.

Revisiting Coactivation ("Froment's Maneuver") in Parkinson's Disease: A 
Physiological Approach.

Yücel M(1), Odorfer T(1), Volkmann J(1), Zeller D(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Neurology, University Hospital Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany.

BACKGROUND: In the 1920s, Jules Froment extensively studied conditions that 
might exacerbate rigidity in persons with Parkinson's disease (PD).
OBJECTIVE: This cross-sectional, controlled study aimed at investigating the 
physiological basis, in particular motor cortical contribution to enhanced 
rigidity during contralateral extremity movements.
METHODS: Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded in 42 patients with PD and 
42 age-matched healthy control subjects. Resting and active motor thresholds, 
MEP latency and amplitude, contralateral (cCSP) and ipsilateral cortical silent 
period (iCSP), and transcallosal conduction time (TCT) were obtained without and 
during coactivation maneuver in the dopaminergic on state.
RESULTS: At baseline, MEP amplitudes, iCSP duration, and TCT were increased in 
patients with PD as compared with control subjects. During coactivation, motor 
thresholds and TCT increased, whereas cCSP showed a marked decrease in patients 
with PD.
CONCLUSIONS: The reduction of cCSP during coactivation points to a disinhibition 
of pyramidal output. Pyramidal disinhibition may most likely underlie the 
enhancement of rigidity during coactivation. © 2025 International Parkinson and

BACKGROUND: The blood concentration of myeloperoxidase (MPO) is related to the 
severity of many age-related inflammatory diseases. However, it is unknown 
whether enzyme activity in the blood provides information on the degree of 
functional disability of Parkinson's disease (PD), a multifactorial disease in 
which aging and inflammation play an important role.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to discern the relationship between MPO 
activity in blood serum and the clinical characteristics of PD, assessed by 
disease rating scales and neuroimaging methods.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 217 participants (114 patients and 
103 controls). Disease rating scales included the Hoehn-Yahr scale, the 
International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society-sponsored revision of the 
Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor section (MDS-UPDRS), and the 
Schwab-England Daily Living scale. The neuroimaging study was based on dopamine 
transporter single-photon emission computed tomography (DAT-SPECT) and specific 
binding ratio (SBR) quantification of 123I-Ioflupane on basal ganglia.
RESULTS: The findings revealed that serum MPO activity significantly increased 
in PD patients (P < 0.0001). MPO activity correlated with the degree of clinical 
impairment measured with rating scales and with striatal DAT availability 
assessed with DAT-SPECT. Multivariate linear regression, correcting for all 
confounding factors, shows that the Hoehn-Yahr staging (P = 0.004) and left 
striatum specific binding ratio (SBR) (P < 0.05) are predictors of serum MPO 
activity, along with dysthyroidism and statins use (P < 0.005). MPO activity 
cutoff greater than 40.350 U/L differentiated patients from controls with good 
accuracy (78.9%).
CONCLUSIONS: In PD, MPO activity in blood serum is associated with the stage of 
functional disability, apart from dysthyroidism and use of statins, assessed 
with the Hoehn-Yahr scale and  striatal DAT binding.

BACKGROUND: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting the subthalamic nucleus (STN) 
can effectively treat motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, 
optimal patient selection remains challenging due to the inadequacy of outcome 
predictors. Most clinicians rely on levodopa response to predict DBS motor 
outcomes, yet previous studies have identified other MRI-based predictors 
including resting-state functional connectivity (FC) and volumetric measures.
OBJECTIVES: To compare the predictive value of functional and volumetric MRI 
data with levodopa response alone for motor outcomes in STN DBS for PD.
METHODS: We analyzed 65 participants who underwent STN DBS for PD at Washington 
University in St. Louis. We used relaxed LASSO regression to select factors 
including clinical, volumetric, and FC measures to generate predictive models 
for relative changes in motor scores post-DBS and assessed cross-validated 
performance. We then compared the relative influence of the predictive factors 
with standardized regression coefficients.
RESULTS: Addition of MRI predictors (FC and volumetric) improved model fit and 
cross-validated model performance over levodopa response alone (levodopa alone: 
R2 = 0.191, RMSE 13.6; MRI + levodopa: R2 = 0.31, RMSE 12.6). Within the 
optimized model, aggregated FC and levodopa response exhibited the highest 
influence on motor outcome prediction.
CONCLUSIONS: Including MRI-based predictors significantly enhances the 
prediction of motor outcomes in STN DBS compared to levodopa response alone, 
with FC predictors demonstrating the greatest influence in the optimized model. 
External validation studies are necessary to confirm the clinical utility of 
these predictors in routine practice.

BACKGROUND: High-frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic 
nucleus (STN) improves Parkinson's disease (PD) motor symptoms but may 
deteriorate verbal fluency (VF). Theta stimulation showed potential cognitive 
benefits associated with motor worsening.
OBJECTIVES: This randomized, double-blind, crossover study evaluated the 
efficacy and safety of combined theta-gamma frequency stimulation on VF in PD 
patients with STN-DBS.
METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 for standard or theta-gamma stimulation. 
VF, motor, and non-motor symptoms were assessed at baseline, 1 h, and 1 month 
after each period. Data were analyzed using a linear mixed-effects model.
RESULTS: Twelve patients completed the study. Non-episodic (P = 0.038) and 
episodic VF (P = 0.030) improved after 1 month of theta-gamma stimulation, while 
phonemic and switching fluency were unchanged. Motor and non-motor outcomes were 
unaffected by the stimulation, with mild adverse events.
CONCLUSION: Combined theta-gamma stimulation may enhance VF in PD patients with 
STN-DBS without worsening motor symptoms or safety concerns. © 2025 The

BACKGROUND: Adropin, a peptide hormone has role in various various physiological 
processes, including metabolic regulation and cardiovascular health. This 
systematic review aimed to synthesize findings from observational studies on the 
involvement of adropin in neurological disorders and cognitive performance.
METHODS: An extensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Web 
of Science, Embase, CORE, and Google Scholar using terms such as "adropin," 
"Neurological Disorders," "cognitive function," "Alzheimer's disease," 
"Parkinson's disease," "cognition," and "brain function." Studies published from 
2020 to 2024 were selected and reviewed. The search and selection process 
adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Out of 127 screened articles, 5 met the 
inclusion criteria for this review.
RESULTS: The combined research findings suggest a consistent link between 
decreased adropin levels and a range of neurological disorders and cognitive 
impairments. In particular, reduced adropin levels were seen in individuals with 
dementia, cognitive impairment, bipolar disorder, Parkinson's disease, and 
multiple sclerosis. These findings highlight adropin's potential role in 
modulating neurological health and cognitive function.
CONCLUSION: This systematic review underscores the importance of adropin in 
neurological health and its potential as a therapeutic agent. Based on the 
observed connections, adropin might serve as a new focus for treating 
neurological disorders, prompting the need for more research and trials.

Converging evidence suggests that erythropoietin (Epo) may be effective in 
alleviating symptoms of many neurological conditions, including traumatic brain 
injury and neurodegenerative disorders. However, a limitation to its use as a 
therapeutic agent is the risk associated with stimulation of hematopoietic 
pathways. To overcome this issue, we used a recombinant adeno-associated viral 
vector (AAV) designed to express a modified form of erythropoietin devoid of 
hematopoietic activity, EpoR76E. Our previous research showed that AAV.EpoR76E 
prevented motor impairments and mitigated loss of dopaminergic neurons in the 
MPTP mouse model of Parkinson's disease. In the present study, a single 
intramuscular injection of AAV expressing EpoR76E prevented cognitive decline in 
the 5xFAD transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease. Consistent with this, 
AAV-EpoR76E prevented the age-related loss of pre-and post-synaptic proteins 
synaptophysin and PSD-95 normally seen in 5xFAD transgenics. Additionally, the 
treatment reduced soluble and aggregated amyloid-β levels in 5xFAD mice, and 
prevented the loss of neurons in the medial septum and vertical limb of the 
diagonal band, the primary cholinergic projections to the hippocampus. Together, 
these results suggest that AAV-EpoR76E might represent a novel therapeutic 
approach for Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.

The current work initially focused on the custom synthesis of ILB-162, an 
innovative calcineurin inhibitor, known chemically as 
N-(5-chloro-2-hydroxyphenyl)-2-(morpholin-4-yl-methyl) benzamide to get a yield 
of 25 mg with 90.73% purity and confirmed its significant calcineurin inhibitory 
potential in vitro having very low IC50 value (0.057 µM). Further assessment in 
L929 cells revealed low cytotoxicity (LD50 = 305.28 µg/mL) and the 
neuroprotection evaluated in SHSY 5Y cells induced with 6OHDA, identified 
50 µg/mL as the optimal protective dose. The Parkinson's disease (PD) models in 
the current study were divided into three groups; Normal control (NC) without 
any treatment, Disease Control (DC) induced with chemical screens (6OHDA for 
SHSY 5Y cell line and Rotenone for C. elegans) and treated with ILB-162 group 
(induced cells treated with 50 µg/mL ILB-162), for accessing molecular as well 
as behavioral effects. In the Cell line models, ILB-162 treatment significantly 
reduced intracellular ROS as well as reversed α-synuclein overexpression, 
indicating its potential to reverse the molecular pathology underlying PD. 
Subsequent studies using C. elegans PD model assessed toxicity 
(LD50 = 1436.39 µM) comparable to in vitro observations and demonstrated the 
outstanding capability of ILB-162 to restore the dopamine-dependent behaviors 
which were disrupted in DC. These findings suggest that ILB-162 can be a 
promising therapeutic candidate against PD, justifying the further development.

INTRODUCTION: Parkinson's disease (PD) presents with diverse motor and non-motor 
symptoms, some of which do not fully respond to dopamine replacement therapy. To 
clarify the effects of the adenosine A2A receptor antagonist istradefylline 
(IST) on PD symptoms, we conducted a subanalysis of the 37-week ISTRA ADJUST PD 
randomized controlled trial.
METHODS: Patients with PD experiencing wearing-off with levodopa at 
300-400 mg/day were randomized 1:1 to receive IST or no IST (control). Levodopa 
doses were titrated according to clinical severity throughout the study. PD 
symptoms were assessed using the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's 
Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) and Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 
(PDQ-39).
RESULTS: The efficacy analyses included 105 patients (IST, n = 52; control, 
n = 53). Regarding MDS-UPDRS subitems in patients in the IST group, significant 
improvements (p < 0.05) were observed at week 36 compared with baseline for both 
motor (e.g., facial expression, rigidity, finger tapping, toe tapping, time 
spent in the off state, and complexity of motor fluctuation) and non-motor 
(e.g., daytime sleepiness, fatigue, and doing hobbies and other activities) 
symptoms. In patients in the control group, significant improvements (p < 0.05) 
were observed for motor symptoms only. Regarding PDQ-39 subitems in patients in 
the IST group, significant improvements (p < 0.05) were observed at week 36 
compared with baseline in doing up buttons or shoelaces, writing, feeling angry 
or bitter, and unexpectedly falling asleep during the day.
CONCLUSION: IST can improve motor and non-motor symptoms and quality of life 
suggesting that it provides more comprehensive improvement in PD symptoms than 
increasing the levodopa dose alone.

BACKGROUND: Non-motor symptoms (NMS) are frequently overlooked, yet they 
significantly contribute to the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) or 
atypical parkinsonism (AP), which include multiple system atrophy (MSA), 
progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Moreover, discrepancies exist in non-motor 
symptom scale (NMSS) scores for AP and PD, and no consensus has yet been 
reached.
PURPOSE: We evaluated and compared the NMS and their association with life 
quality in patients with AP and PD.
METHODS: This cross-sectional observational report at a single-centre enrolling 
204 patients (155 PD, 49 AP (27 MSA), and 22 PSP) from a tertiary care 
hospital's movement disorder clinic. We used Movement Disorder Society Unified 
Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS UPDRS)-III and modified Hoehn and Yahr 
(H&Y) to compute a motor score and disease severity, respectively. We assessed 
patients' mental capabilities, such as cognitive impairment, through a 
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Meanwhile, the NMSS determined the NMSs. 
Quality of life (QoL) was estimated by PD Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39).
RESULTS: We observed insignificant differences between the PD and atypical 
parkinsonian syndrome (APS) groups based on disease duration and gender. 
Worsened motor disability and disease severity were observed in AP (PSP>MSA) (P 
< .001). The mean NMSS scores for PD, PSP and MSA were 23.7 ± 27.9, 47.6 ± 41.3 
and 65.6 ± 35.5, respectively (P < .05). MSA had a comparatively high score for 
sexual, cardiovascular and urinary domains, while PSP scored higher for 
memory/attention domains. In contrast, PD group revealed significantly lower 
scores for perceptual and sexual domains.
CONCLUSION: Compared to PD, NMS was severe and highly prevalent among AP (MSA > 
PSP), which could be confirmed through the prevalence of sexual cardiovascular 
and urinary domains in MSA, while attention and mood/cognition, and sleep in 
PSP.

Neuronal titration of Snca via enhancer disruption mitigates disease onset in a 
Parkinson's disease mouse model.

Boyd RJ, Kho AR, McClymont SA, Loftus SK, Ko HS, McCallion AS.

α-synuclein ( SNCA ) is the greatest genetic risk factor for sporadic 
Parkinson's Disease (PD). Misfolding and overexpression of SNCA underlie 
pathognomonic features of PD, including SNCA aggregates and midbrain 
dopaminergic (mbDA) neurodegeneration. We recently identified an SNCA intronic 
sequence that harbors variation associated with PD risk and demonstrated its 
role as a neuronal cis-regulatory element (CRE). Here, we engineered a mouse 
model lacking this sequence, which exhibits significantly reduced Snca 
transcription in mbDA neurons. Employing a battery of motor, molecular, and 
histological assays in an established mouse model of PD, we demonstrate that 
mice lacking this Snca enhancer are protected against PD-relevant histopathology 
and motor impairments. By targeting a cell-dependent CRE to diminish PD 
onset/progression in mice, we introduce a potentially powerful therapeutic 
avenue for PD.

Traditional aptasensors struggle to distinguish molecules with highly similar 
chemical structures due to the inherent flexibility of aptamers, which form 
'nano-bushes' causing non-specific adsorption and reducing sensor specificity. 
To address this, we propose a novel strategy of anchoring aptamers at the 
single-molecule level onto atomic anchoring sites. We have designed a gold 
single-atom/titanium dioxide (Au SA/TiO2) photoelectrode to immobilize a 
dopamine (DA)-selective aptamer, enabling the fabrication of a 
photoelectrochemical single-molecule aptamer sensor (PEC-sm-aptasensor). This 
sensor can selectively detect DA in vivo in different brain regions of living 
mice. This advancement has revolutionized our understanding of DA variation in 
the prefrontal cortex of Parkinson's disease (PD) mice. In contrast to previous 
beliefs, we have discovered a new neurotransmitter dynamic pattern: while the 
total concentration of neurotransmitters decreases, the concentration of DA 
remains constant, thus not affecting cognitive levels. This finding is crucial 
for a more targeted understanding of PD and opens avenues for more effective 
treatments and diagnostic methods.

BACKGROUND: Research links retinal changes to cognitive decline in Parkinson's 
disease (PD), paralleling findings in Alzheimer's, raising questions about 
specific cortical patterns of cognition-related retinal abnormalities in PD.
OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to explore whether retinal thinning linked to 
cognitive decline could act as a potential biomarker for cerebral atrophy in PD.
METHODS: Twenty seven patients with PD underwent cognitive and neurological 
assessments, along with retinal imaging using OCT and cerebral imaging using 
structural MRI. After identifying abnormal retinal layers associated with 
cognitive dysfunction through partial correlation analyses controlling for 
age-related effects, associations between these retinal layers and the 
parcellated cerebral gray matter were assessed using multiple 
comparison-corrected partial correlation analyses adjusted for age and gender.
RESULTS: Significant positive correlations were found between cognitive 
impairment measured by MoCA and specific retinal layers (IPL, GCL, and RNFL). Of 
these, strong associations were observed between the IPL and GCL and cortical 
thickness in brain the temporal lobe and limbic cortex, with more detailed 
further analysis showing significant correlations particularly within the middle 
and posterior cingulate cortex in the limbic cortex and the middle and superior 
temporal gyrus in the temporal lobe.
CONCLUSION: Correlations between retinal thinning, cognitive decline, and 
specific patterns of cortical atrophy in PD support a potential of retinal 
measurements as a biomarker for cognitive impairment linked to cerebral 
neurodegeneration.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder characterized 
by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra that leads to 
bradykinesia and rest tremors. While the molecular mechanisms underlying PD are 
not fully understood, rising evidence shows neuroinflammation as a key factor in 
dopaminergic neuron damage. The soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) has appeared as 
a key player in neuroinflammation associated with PD which represents itself as 
a promising drug target. Here, we employed a structure-based virtual screening 
methodology using repurposed drugs from the DrugBank database to identify 
high-affinity potential inhibitors of sEH. Results showed that two hit 
molecules, Fluspirilene and Penfluridol, demonstrated appreciable docking 
potential and specificity toward the sEH active site. These molecules exhibited 
favorable pharmacological properties and formed critical interactions with 
residues essential for sEH activity. Further, all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) 
simulations followed by principal component analysis and free energy landscape 
were carried out which provide deeper insights into the conformational stability 
and interaction mechanisms of sEH in complex with Fluspirilene and Penfluridol. 
The simulation results indicated that the interaction of sEH with Fluspirilene 
and Penfluridol contributed to the stabilization of its structure throughout the 
MD trajectories of 500 ns. These findings collectively suggest that Fluspirilene 
and Penfluridol hold potential as repurposed leads for the development of sEH 
inhibitors, which offer therapeutic implications for combating PD and other 
associated conditions.

Hypermanganesaemia with Dystonia 1 and 2 (HMNDYT1 and 2) are inherited, 
autosomal recessive disorders caused by pathogenic variants in the genes 
encoding the manganese transporters SLC30A10 and SLC39A14, respectively. 
Impaired hepatic and enterocytic manganese uptake (SLC39A14) and excretion 
(SLC30A10) lead to deposition of manganese in the basal ganglia resulting in 
childhood-onset dystonia-parkinsonism. HMNDYT1 is characterized by additional 
features due to manganese accumulation in the liver causing cirrhosis, 
polycythaemia, and depleted iron stores. High blood manganese levels and 
pathognomonic MRI brain appearances of manganese deposition resulting in T1 
hyperintensity of the basal ganglia are diagnostic clues. Treatment is limited 
to chelation therapy and iron supplementation that can prevent disease 
progression. Due to their rarity, the awareness of the inherited manganese 
transporter defects is limited. Here, we provide consensus expert 
recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with HMNDYT1 and 2 
in order to facilitate early diagnosis and optimize clinical outcome. These 
recommendations were developed through an evidence and consensus-based process 
led by a group of 13 international experts across the disciplines of metabolic 
medicine, neurology, hematology, genetics, and radiology, and address the 
clinical presentation, diagnostic investigations, principles of treatment, and 
monitoring of patients with HMNDYT1 and 2.

BackgroundMost structured visual hallucinations (VH) in Parkinson's disease (PD) 
involve animate-social objects, yet current theories fail to account for the 
prominent social component of VH in PD.ObjectiveTo study social perception in PD 
patients with VH in a behavioral task and its relationship with social traits 
such as perceived social isolation and anthropomorphism (tendency to ascribe 
human-like characteristics to non-human stimuli).MethodsIn this online web-based 
study, 28 PD with visual hallucinations (PD-VH), 55 PD patients without 
hallucinations (PD-nH), and 45 age-matched healthy controls (HC) performed a 
visual social task (human numerosity estimation), a control task, and filled an 
anthropomorphism and a loneliness questionnaire.ResultsOur data reveal a deficit 
in social visual perception characterized by a larger overestimation bias in 
human numerosity estimation in PD-VH versus control PD-nH and HC. Moreover, 
PD-VH had higher social traits of anthropomorphism and loneliness versus control 
PD-nH and HC and the overestimation bias was absent for non-human control 
stimuli.ConclusionsThese data describe a stronger social visual deficit and 
higher social traits in PD patients with VH, suggesting that neurodegenerative 
changes in PD-VH predominantly affect structures involved in social visual 
perception.

Plain Language Summary: Most structured visual hallucinations (VH) in 
Parkinson's disease (PD) involve animate-social objects, yet current theories 
fail to account for the prominent social component of VH in PD. Here, we 
conducted an online web-based study that 170 PD patients and 45 age-matched 
healthy controls (HC) carried out remotely from their homes, investigating (1) 
social perception in PD patients with VH (PD-VH) using a behavioral visual 
social task (human numerosity estimation) and (2) its relationship with social 
traits such as perceived social isolation and anthropomorphism (tendency to 
ascribe human-like characteristics to non-human stimuli). Our data reveals a 
deficit in social visual perception (larger overestimation bias in human 
numerosity estimation, absent for non-human control stimuli) and higher social 
traits (anthropomorphism and loneliness) in PD-VH versus PD patients without 
hallucinations and HC, suggesting that neurodegenerative changes in PD-VH 
predominantly affect functions and structures involved in social visual 
perception.

BackgroundParkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. 
Awareness and the evidence supporting the merits of palliative care (PC) 
approaches to people with Parkinson's disease (PwP) are increasing.ObjectiveThis 
review aimed to address four key questions related to PC for PwPs and their 
caregivers: i) What are the indicators for timely access to PC? ii) When should 
PC be introduced? iii) What are the current care models for providing PC? iv) 
What are the barriers and facilitators at the organizational level?MethodsA 
systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane, EMBASE, 
and MEDLINE (2006-2024). Six reviewers independently screened abstracts and full 
texts, and thematic synthesis was applied to develop analytical themes. 
Reporting followed PRISMA guidelines.ResultsOut of 894 studies, 70 were 
included. PwPs were infrequently referred to PC services, and while several 
referral criteria were identified, no consensus emerged. Barriers to accessing 
PC included insufficient information, inadequate education, difficulties 
determining referral timing, limited home-based care options, inconsistent 
provider support, and disparities linked to socioeconomic and cultural factors. 
Facilitators included improved care coordination and education for PwPs, 
caregivers, and healthcare providers. Effective PC models were identified, 
including home-based, hospital-based, and community-based approaches, which 
improved quality of life and reduced healthcare costs.ConclusionsEstablishing 
consensus on referral timing and criteria is essential for integrating PC into 
Parkinson's disease care. Overcoming barriers requires enhanced education, 
better care coordination, and targeted interventions to address disparities, 
ensuring comprehensive, patient-centred care for PwPs and their caregivers.

A progressive tremorgenic syndrome characterised by ataxia and head nodding is 
well documented in sheep and cattle affected by chronic Phalaris toxicosis 
(CPT), and is increasingly documented in the eastern grey kangaroo {(EGK), 
Macropus giganteus} in southeastern Australia. It is characterised on gross 
necropsy by areas of acquired localised pigment deposits within the brain. This 
pigment was previously considered a storage disease, but more recently has been 
determined to be a metabolic breakdown product of tryptamine alkaloids within 
Phalaris species (spp) of introduced grasses. The study included 61 EGKs that 
were euthanased after a diagnosis of clinically advanced CPT, histopathological 
studies were performed on all cases and transmission electron microscopic 
studies on six brains. Histological examination of the brains from EGKs revealed 
brown pigmentation of neurons, particularly of large motor neurons, with 
accumulations of discrete granules in the cytoplasm that stained positive with 
stains used to identify melanin. This feature and the characteristic 
ultrastructural appearance of the pigment granules leaves little doubt that the 
pigment is primarily melanin in nature. Specifically, ultrastructural detail of 
the granules was consistent with neuromelanin present in the brains of higher 
order primates and humans and has been associated with susceptibility to 
neurodegenerative diseases in man including Parkinson's disease. Given greater 
urbanisation and reduced access to native pasture a greater understanding of 
pathogenesis of CPT is of major importance not only for kangaroo welfare but 
potentially as a model for neurodegenerative diseases in humans.

BACKGROUND: Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is an enzyme that 
involves into NMN-NAD + synthesis which involves into cellular metabolism 
related with aging, immune function, and neurodegeneration. However, its roles 
in early embryo development are still unclear.
METHODS: In present study we disturbed the NAMPT activity and employed 
immunofluorescence staining and live cell imaging to explore its roles during 
early embryo development.
RESULTS: We showed that NAMPT mRNA level was stable during mouse early embryo 
development, and NAMPT accumulated in the nucleus of blastomeres in mouse 
embryos. The loss of NAMPT activity disturbed the early cleavage from zygote to 
2-cell, 4-cell to morula formation in the dose-dependent manner. We found that 
NAMPT inhibition disrupted mitochondria function in 2-cell embryos, showing 
decreased mitochondria number and aberrant accumulation in the blastomeres, 
which further disturb mitochondrial membrane potential level and elevated ROS 
level in embryos, indicating the occurrence of oxidative stress. Moreover, NAMPT 
inhibition also increased the apoptotic index, showing with increased Annexin-V 
signals and apoptotic gene expression.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our study provided the evidence that NAMPT was 
essential for the mitochondria function to control oxidative stress and 
apoptosis during mouse early embryo development.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder 
characterized by nigrostriatal degeneration and aggregation of α-synuclein 
(α-Syn) with accumulation of insoluble aggregates in Lewy bodies. Familial 
mutations in α-Syn are associated with the development of PD. Accumulation of 
insoluble aggregates results in neuronal toxicity. Identification of compounds 
that inhibit seeding activity of α-Syn is of great importance. Here we 
investigate the potential of H2S donor, sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), to inhibit 
α-Syn aggregation. We examined the effect of NaHS on fibril growth kinetics and 
the structural change of α-Syn fibrils formed by self-seeding and cross-seeding 
of wild-type (wt) and PD familial α-Syn mutations. NaHS slowed both self- and 
cross-seeded A53T α-Syn fibril formation but not wild-type fibril formation. We 
observed a decrease in the formed fibril length in vitro. We examined the effect 
on fibril formation within cells. NaHS significantly reduced the number and 
filament length of formed oligomers in an α-Syn overexpressing cell model. 
Furthermore, NaHS rescued viability of A53T α-Syn overexpressing cells seeded 
with wt- and mutant preformed fibrils. These results support a 
conformation-specific effect of hydrogen sulfide on alpha-synuclein aggregation 
and cell viability which deserves further exploration for therapeutic potential.

This review synthesizes recent literature, primarily from the last 5 years, to 
highlight the impact of innovative technologies and analytical approaches on the 
application of positron emission tomography (PET) in movement disorders. PET 
remains a cornerstone for investigating these conditions, with recent 
advancements enhancing our understanding of disease pathophysiology and 
progression. Established findings, such as the ability of 
[18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose PET (18F-FDG PET) to differentiate Parkinson's disease 
(PD) from atypical parkinsonian syndromes based on characteristic metabolic 
patterns, have been consistently validated. PD typically presents with relative 
hypermetabolism in the basal ganglia, thalamus and cerebellum, while atypical 
parkinsonisms exhibit more widespread subcortical hypometabolism. Technological 
innovations, particularly in quantification methods and metabolic connectivity 
analysis, have improved diagnostic precision and provided deeper insights into 
disease mechanisms. Dopaminergic PET imaging, crucial for assessing presynaptic 
and postsynaptic dysfunction, has also benefited from these advances. The field 
is further evolving with the development of novel tracers targeting pathological 
hallmarks, such as alpha-synuclein in PD and multiple system atrophy (MSA), tau 
in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and cortico-basal degeneration (CBD), 
and tracers for neuroinflammation, microglial activation, and neurotransmitter 
systems like serotonin and acetylcholine. While PET is not yet routinely used 
for the clinical assessment of Huntington's disease or ataxia, research 
applications are expanding, driven by the potential of these new tracers and 
analytical techniques. These advancements not only reinforce existing knowledge 
but also open new avenues for enhancing the understanding and management of 
movement disorders.

Neuroinflammation plays a pivotal role in the progression of Parkinson's disease 
(PD), and molecules capable of inhibiting neuroinflammation hold significant 
promise as therapeutic targets for PD. The transient receptor potential 
melastatin 8 (TRPM8), a transmembrane protein with well-documented 
anti-inflammatory properties, is prominently expressed in macrophages. This 
study marks the first exploration of the anti-PD effects of TRPM8 activation and 
its underlying mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate that Icilin, a 
small-molecule TRPM8 agonist, conferred beneficial effects in a PD mouse model, 
including improved motor function, reduced dopaminergic neuronal damage, and 
suppressed neuroinflammation. Mechanistically, Icilin alleviated 
neuroinflammation in microglia through TRPM8 activation, which modulated the 
Nrf2/HO-1 and NF-κB pathways, thereby shielding neurons from microglia-mediated 
inflammatory injury. These findings not only underscore the therapeutic 
potential of TRPM8 in PD but also highlight its relevance to functional food 
science, as TRPM8 activation could be harnessed to develop dietary interventions 
with neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties. In conclusion, our study 
identifies TRPM8 as a promising therapeutic target for PD by regulating 
neuroinflammation via the Nrf2/HO-1 and NF-κB pathways, offering novel insights 
for the development of functional foods aimed at mitigating neurodegenerative 
diseases.

The subthalamic nucleus (STN), the main driving force of the basal ganglia, is 
innervated by brainstem serotonin (5-HT) neurons with highly plastic axonal 
arborization. A pathologically-induced rearrangement of the ascending 5-HT 
projections could contribute to the disrupted firing pattern of STN neurons 
observed in Parkinson's disease (PD). This light and electron microscope study 
was designed to characterize the neuroadaptive changes of 5-HT inputs to the 
different functional territories of the STN in four cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca 
fascicularis) rendered parkinsonian by systemic injections of 
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and four control animals. 
Using an unbiased stereological approach, we report a significant decrease of 
the density of 5-HT axon varicosities immunolabeled for the 5-HT membrane 
transporter (SERT), across all STN functional territories of MPTP-treated 
monkeys. In MPTP-treated animals, the SERT+ axon varicosities are larger than in 
control monkeys. In both experimental conditions they are only partially 
synaptic. A preserved length of 5-HT axons in the STN along with a conserved 
number of 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus is observed. Overall, our 
results indicate that, in parkinsonian monkeys, the 5-HT axons projecting to the 
STN are preserved but endowed with significantly less axon varicosities. Such 
neuroadaptive change could lead to a lower ambient level of 5-HT in this basal 
ganglia component, representing a compensatory mechanism designed to cope with 
the hyperexcitability of STN neurons that is known to occur in PD.

Mitochondrial excessive fission is one of representative pathological features 
and a principal element triggering the neuronal damage in Parkinson's disease 
(PD). Inhibiting mitochondrial excessive fission benefits the pathology of PD 
through promoting mitochondrial biogenesis, but the detailed mechanism has not 
been clarified. In our study, we revealed that inhibiting mitochondrial 
excessive fission by Mdivi-1, the dynamin related protein 1 (DRP1) inhibitor, 
increased the expression and nuclear translocation of peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) coactivator 1α (PGC-1α), as well as 
its downstream transcriptional factors, nuclear respiratory factor 1/2 (NRF1/2) 
and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), and therefore promoted 
mitochondrial biogenesis. Suppression of mitochondrial excessive fission 
alleviated dopaminergic synaptic injury, neuronal apoptosis and motor 
dysfunction, while inhibiting PGC-1α attenuated these ameliorative effects in 
both in-vitro and in-vivo PD models. Mechanistic study showed that inhibiting 
mitochondrial excessive fission facilitated the expression of PGC-1α, NRF1 and 
TFAM by activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine kinase II 
(CaMKII)/cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) pathway. Inhibiting 
mitochondrial excessive fission also activated AMP-activated serine/threonine 
kinase (AMPK)/Sirtuin1 (Sirt1) pathway, and then phosphorylated and deacetylated 
PGC-1α by post-translational modifications. In conclusion, inhibiting 
mitochondrial excessive fission could promote mitochondrial biogenesis through 
activation of PGC-1α and therefore rescue the impaired dopaminergic neurons, 
which provided evidence for targeting mitochondrial excessive fission for the 
treatment of PD and new drug developments.

Neuroinflammation is a key feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). The cannabinoid 
receptor type 2 (CB2R) is expressed by cells of the innate and adaptive immune 
systems. Inhibition of monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) with JZL184 increases the 
levels of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), which is 
neuroprotective for dopaminergic neurons. The aim of this study was to determine 
whether the neuroprotective effect of MAGL inhibition is mediated by CB2R 
activation on specific immune cell populations. Experimental parkinsonism was 
induced by chronic administration of MPTP and probenecid. A specific increase in 
CD4+ T cell infiltration was detected in the midbrain of parkinsonian mice and 
was reduced by administration of JZL184. JZL184 had no effect in CB2R KO mice, 
suggesting that CB2R is required for neuroprotection. In the brain, CB2R 
expression was restricted to myeloid cells and lymphocytes, and increased in 
microglia under parkinsonian conditions. Administration of a central CB2R 
agonist, JWH133, exerted a beneficial effect similar to that of JZL184, whereas 
the peripheral agonist RO304 lacked neuroprotective activity. These results were 
confirmed using chimeric mice. In silico analysis, showed that transcripts 
related to 2-AG biosynthesis are downregulated in the midbrain microglia from PD 
patients. Our results show that activation of CB2R in the brain prevents 
nigrostriatal degeneration, CD4+ T cell infiltration and TNFα production in the 
midbrain of parkinsonian mice. The reduced 2-AG signaling in microglia from PD 
patients suggests that activation of microglial CB2R may be an interesting 
strategy for the treatment of PD.

PURPOSE: This study aims to investigate the early change in cortical thickness 
and surface area in early-stage depressed PD (dPD) patients, and its 
associations with severity of depression.
METHODS: 59 patients with dPD, 27 patients with non-depressed PD (ndPD), and 43 
healthy controls (HC) were recruited. The dPD patients were subclassified into 
mild-depressed PD (mi-dPD, n=24), moderate-depressed PD (mo-dPD, n=21) and 
severe-depressed PD (se-dPD, n=14) subgroups. Structural MRI and surface-based 
morphometry analysis were applied to compare differences in cortical thickness 
and surface area among groups, and their correlations with Beck Depression 
Inventory (BDI) scores were analyzed.
RESULTS: Compared with ndPD, dPD exhibited cortical thinning in the dorsolateral 
prefrontal cortex (dlPFC, mainly invoving the left superior frontal and 
bilateral middle frontal gyri), the right pars opercularis and bilateral lateral 
occipital gyri. The mean cortical thickness values within these regions 
negatively correlated with BDI scores. Subgroup analysis revealed that patients 
with mi-dPD had cortical thinning only in the right middle frontal gyrus, while 
se-dPD showed cortical thinning more extensively involving the right fusiform 
gyrus, posterior cingulate gyrus, and pars opercularis. There was no significant 
change in cortical surface area in either the dPD or its subgroups.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that PD-related depression was associated 
with decrease of cortical thickness, instead of surface area, of which the 
patterns correlated with the severity of depression. Cortical thinning in dlPFC, 
mainly involving the left middle frontal gyrus, may serve as a potential 
neuroimaging indicator for early recognition of depression in PD patients.

The toxic species formed by the pathological aggregation of α-synuclein (α-Syn) 
is one of the core pathogenic mechanisms in Parkinson's disease, leading to 
mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and ultimately degeneration and loss 
of dopaminergic neurons. Developing effective inhibitors targeting α-Syn 
fibrillization critically requires the simultaneous achievement of (1) strong 
and selective binding of α-Syn for efficient disintegration of fibrils, as well 
as (2) robust transmembrane capability for efficient cellular uptake. Herein, 
the co-assembly of guanidinium-modified calixarene (GCA) and cyclodextrin (CD), 
termed GCA-CD, is screened fully accommodating these conditions. GCA-CD binds 
tightly and selectively towards α-Syn, thereby effectively inhibiting α-Syn 
aggregation and disintegrating its fibrils, meanwhile the guanidinium of GCA can 
additionally improve the transmembrane capability of the co-assembly. In vivo 
investigations demonstrate that the GCA-CD nanomedicine significantly rescues 
motor deficits and nigrostriatal degeneration of PD-like rats by decreasing the 
content of α-Syn as well as restoring mitochondrial dysfunction and suppressing 
oxidative stress. Astonishingly, transcriptome analysis further reveals the role 
of GCA-CD in dampening cuproptosis through inhibiting FDX1/LIAS signaling 
pathway, highlighting the multifaceted therapeutic effects of the co-assembly in 
PD. The findings in this study underscore the comprehensive exposition on the 
actual function mechanisms of the therapeutic agents, thereby providing valuable 
insights for informing material design.

Protein misfolding and aggregation drive some of the most prevalent and lethal 
disorders of our time, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, now 
affecting tens of millions of people worldwide. The complexity of these 
diseases, which are often multifactorial and related to age and lifestyle, has 
made it challenging to identify the causes of the accumulation of aberrant 
protein deposits. An insight into the origins of these deposits comes from 
reports of a widespread presence of protein aggregates even under normal 
cellular conditions. This observation is best accounted for by the thermodynamic 
hypothesis of protein aggregation. According to this hypothesis, many proteins 
are expressed at levels close to their supersaturation limits, so that their 
native states are metastable against aggregation. Here we integrate the evidence 
behind this hypothesis and outline actionable therapeutic strategies that could 
halt protein aggregation at its source.

BACKGROUND: The blood-brain barrier (BBB) presents a formidable challenge in 
neuropharmacology, limiting the delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain. 
Exosomes, nature's nanocarriers, have emerged as a promising solution due to 
their biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, and innate ability to traverse the 
BBB. A thorough examination of BBB anatomy and physiology reveals the 
complexities of neurological drug delivery and underscores the limitations of 
conventional methods.
MAIN BODY: This review explores the potential of exosome-powered 
neuropharmaceutics, highlighting their structural and functional properties, 
biogenesis, and mechanisms of release. Their intrinsic advantages in drug 
delivery, including enhanced stability and efficient cellular uptake, are 
discussed in detail. Exosomes naturally overcome BBB barriers through specific 
translocation mechanisms, making them a compelling vehicle for targeted brain 
therapies. Advances in engineering strategies, such as genetic and biochemical 
modifications, drug loading techniques, and specificity enhancement, further 
bolster their therapeutic potential. Exosome-based approaches hold immense 
promise for treating a spectrum of neurological disorders, including 
Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple 
sclerosis (MS), brain tumors, stroke, and psychiatric conditions.
CONCLUSION: By leveraging their innate properties and engineering innovations, 
exosomes offer a versatile platform for precision neurotherapeutics. Despite 
their promise, challenges remain in clinical translation, including large-scale 
production, standardization, and regulatory considerations. Future research 
directions in exosome nanobiotechnology aim to refine these therapeutic 
strategies, unlocking new avenues for treating neurological diseases. This 
review underscores the transformative impact of exosome-based drug delivery, 
paving the way for next-generation therapies that can effectively penetrate the 
BBB and revolutionize neuropharmacology.

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an efficient tool for non-invasively 
evaluating retinal structures. Retinal thinning changes assessed using OCT are 
recognized as potential biomarkers for systemic conditions such as Alzheimer's 
disease, Parkinson's disease, and chronic kidney disease. However, age-related 
retinal changes remain largely unexplored, complicating the differentiation 
between physiological and pathological alterations. Here, we introduced a highly 
granular approach to assess age-related spatial changes in the inner retina 
using latent retinal archetypes, identifying 36 retinal archetypes of macula and 
peripapillary sector images from 189,387 OCTs of 22,494 individuals. 
Subsequently, we evaluated the associations between these archetypes and age; 
age-related archetypes are characterized by total or superior thinning in the 
macula sector. Among individuals with myopia, the inferior thinning pattern in 
the macula ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer was associated with aging. The 
age-related effects in the peripapillary sector were primarily reflected in the 
shape of retinal artery trajectories. Overall, latent retinal archetypes would 
offer new avenues for the effective utilization of retinal biomarkers in 
age-related diseases.

Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by the 
degeneration of the nervous system, leading to impaired motor and non-motor 
functions. Early symptoms include tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia, with 
progressive deterioration over time. This study employs a multi-criteria 
decision-making approach, integrating Fuzzy TOPSIS and Quantitative 
Structure-Property Relationship (QSPR) analysis, to evaluate and rank 17 
Parkinson's disease medications based on their physicochemical properties. 
Molecular structures were encoded as adjacency matrices using MATLAB 2017, and 
six Sombor index variants-computed via a custom Maple 2020 algorithm-served as 
topological descriptors for QSPR modeling. Eight critical physicochemical 
properties were analyzed: polarizability (P), boiling point (BP), surface 
tension (ST), polar surface area (PSA), flash point (FP), molar refractivity 
(MR), enthalpy of vaporization (EV), and molar volume (MV). The Fuzzy TOPSIS 
ranking revealed bromocriptine as the top-performing drug for boiling point 
(BP), while comparative rankings across all properties are tabulated for 
clinical reference. Validation metrics, including coefficient of determination, 
mean squared error , and mean absolute error, confirmed model robustness. 
Notably, surface tension (ST) and polar surface area (PSA) showed weaker 
correlations (R2 < 0.5, p > 0.05), highlighting limitations in their 
predictability via Sombor indices. This work demonstrates the utility of 
combining chemical graph theory, QSPR modeling, and Fuzzy TOPSIS for rational 
drug evaluation in neurodegenerative disorders. The methodology offers a 
framework for prioritizing therapeutics based on physicochemical profiles, with 
implications for optimizing Parkinson's disease management.

The D620N variant in Vacuolar Protein Sorting 35 (VPS35) causes 
autosomal-dominant, late-onset Parkinson's disease. VPS35 is a core subunit of 
the retromer complex that canonically recycles transmembrane cargo from sorting 
endosomes. Although retromer cargoes include many synaptic proteins, VPS35's 
neuronal functions are poorly understood. To investigate the consequences of the 
Parkinson's mutation, striatal neurotransmission was assessed in 1- to 
6-month-old VPS35 D620N knock-in (VKI) mice. Spontaneous and 
optogenetically-evoked corticostriatal glutamate transmission was increased in 
VKI spiny projection neurons by 6 months and was unaffected by acute 
leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) inhibition. Total striatal glutamate 
release by iGluSnFR imaging was similar to wild-type. dLight imaging revealed 
robust increases in VKI striatal dopamine release by 6 months, which were 
reversed with acute LRRK2 kinase inhibition. We conclude that increased striatal 
neurotransmission in VKI mice progressively emerges in young-adulthood, and that 
dopamine dysfunction is likely the result of sustained, rapidly-reversible, 
LRRK2 hyperactivity.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterised by motor 
and non-motor symptoms. Recent evidence suggests a role for gut microbiome 
composition and diversity in PD aetiology. This study aimed to explore the 
association between the gut microbiome and PD in a South African population. Gut 
microbial sequencing data (cases: n = 16; controls: n = 42) was generated using 
a 16S rRNA gene (V4) primer pair. Alpha- and beta-diversity were calculated 
using QIIME2, and differential abundance of taxa was evaluated using Analysis of 
Compositions of Microbiomes with Bias Correction (ANCOM-BC). Beta-diversity was 
found to differ significantly between cases and controls, with depletion in the 
relative abundance of Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, Dorea, and Veillonella, and 
enrichment of the relative abundance of Akkermansia and Victivallis. Our study 
found a reduction in butyrate-producing bacteria (e.g. Faecalibacterium and 
Roseburia) and an increase in mucin-degrading bacteria (Akkermansia) in PD cases 
compared to controls. These alterations might be associated with heightened gut 
permeability and inflammation. Longitudinal studies should address the question 
of whether these microbiome differences are a risk factor for, or are consequent 
to, the development of PD.

BackgroundCognitive rehabilitation is a potential intervention for cognitive but 
also motor disorders in Parkinson's disease (PD).ObjectiveTo investigate the 
effects of cognitive rehabilitation on balance and motor symptoms in PD.MethodsA 
randomized controlled trial in a community setting, in people with 
mild-to-moderate PD (Hoehn and Yahr ≤ III) without cognitive impairment 
(MoCA ≥ 24) was conducted. Thirty-nine participants were randomly allocated to 
receive a cognitive intervention (Experimental Group, n = 20) or no intervention 
(Control Group, n = 19). The experimental protocol involved self-administered 
cognitive rehabilitation using the NeuronUP platform, focusing on sustained 
attention and information processing speed training (30 min/day, 3 days/week, 4 
weeks). The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) was the main outcome. Motor variables 
included UPDRS-III, Percentage of Limits of Stability (%LOS) and Timed Up and Go 
Test (TUG). Neuropsychological variables included TMT-A, TMT-B, Processing Speed 
(Digit Symbol-Coding and Symbol Search) and Stroop test.ResultsAt 
post-intervention, marginal improvements were observed in BBS (Mean 
Difference = 2.23 points, 95%CI [-0.03, 4.49], p = 0.053) and significant 
improvements in the UPDRS-III (Mean Difference = -4.02 points, 95%CI [-7.82, 
-0.23], p = 0.039). No significant improvements were found in the rest of the 
motor and cognitive variables.ConclusionsSelf-administered cognitive training 
did not improve balance or cognition but significantly reduced motor symptom 
severity in PD. The effect of more intensive or in-person cognitive 
rehabilitation protocols on balance needs to be evaluated.

BackgroundProprioceptive sensory integration is impaired in people with 
Parkinson's (PwP), affecting control of the posture.ObjectiveThe goal of this 
study was to examine the effects of proprioceptive exercises on improvement of 
the ankle proprioception acuity, functional mobility, postural control, and 
quality of life of PwP.MethodsSixteen PwP participated in this semi-experimental 
clinical trial to receive proprioceptive exercises over 10 weeks. Ankle 
kinesthesia and repositioning acuity, four square step test, center of 
pressure-related balance metrics, and PDQ-39 questionnaire were 
measured.ResultsAnkle kinesthesia in plantarflexion is improved after the 
exercises (p = 0.033). Four square step test time was significantly decreased 
(∼780 ms) after proprioceptive exercises (p = 0.008). Significant decreases in 
closed eyes postural metrics of the center of pressure's maximum excursion 
(p = 0.008), maximum velocity (p = 0.035), total mean velocity (p = 0.004), 
range (p = 0.002), and variability (p = 0.002) indicated reduced instabilities. 
Significant correlations between the proprioception and postural metrics in 
closed eyes standing before the exercises were vanished to corroborate the role 
of improved proprioception in boosted postural control. PDQ-39 scores was also 
significantly decreased after the exercises 
(p = 0.021).ConclusionsProprioceptive exercises over 10 weeks improved 
proprioception in people with Parkinson's that caused reduced postural 
instabilities and consequently increased their quality of life.

BackgroundEffects of Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) combined with 
exercise on gait in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have been highly 
inconsistent.ObjectiveTo assess the clinical effects of NIBS combined with 
exercise on gait in PD and analyze the specifics of the intervention protocols 
related to the outcomes.MethodsPubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane 
Library were searched up to July 2023. Included were randomized controlled 
trials that investigated how NIBS combined with exercise affected gait in 
PD.ResultsWe examined nine studies, comprising 242 patients, for our 
meta-analysis. According to our findings, NIBS combined with exercise improved 
TUGT time (MD -0.83; 95% CI, -1.48 to -0.17) and gait parameters including 
stride length (MD 19.93; 95% CI, 3.06 to 36.81). In subgroup analyses of 
different intervention types, UPDRS-III scores were significantly reduced by 
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) combined with exercise (MD 
-5.63; 95% CI, -9.31 to -1.95) and NIBS combined with treadmill training (MD 
-5.95; 95% CI, -10.12 to -1.79). TUGT time (MD -1.07; 95% CI, -1.94 to -0.20) 
and cadence (MD -6.06; 95% CI, -10.24 to -1.87) were significantly affected by 
transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with exercise. NIBS 
combined with physical therapy produced a notable improvement in TUGT time (MD 
-1.31; 95% CI, -2.37 to -0.26).ConclusionsNIBS combined with exercise may have 
synergistic effects on gait performance in PD. To achieve the greatest benefits 
for individuals with PD, future research should concentrate on identifying the 
most appropriate stimulation parameters and intervention features.

BackgroundParkinson's disease (PD) impairs motor and cognitive functions, 
increasing fall risk during dual-task activities. While transcranial direct 
current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive brain stimulation technique, has been 
studied for improving these functions in PD, its effect on dual-task gait 
remains unclear.ObjectiveThis review aims to evaluate the effects of tDCS on 
dual-task gait performance in PD.MethodsA systematic search was conducted in 
PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science for studies published before September 2024. 
Eligible studies included PD patients, used tDCS, and measured dual-task gait 
performance. Two researchers independently assessed methodological quality using 
the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool.ResultsFour randomized controlled trials and four 
crossover studies, involving 222 PD patients (mean age 64.17 years, range 
50.9-72) at Hoehn & Yahr stages 1-3, met the inclusion criteria. Three of six 
studies targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex showed significant 
improvements in dual-task gait performance, particularly in gait speed 
(p ≤ 0.046), compared to sham. No significant improvements were observed with 
primary motor cortex or cerebellar stimulation (all p's ≥ 0.100).ConclusionstDCS 
targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may improve dual-task gait 
performance in PD, but further studies are needed to refine protocols and 
confirm its therapeutic potential.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, which primarily 
impacts the nervous system, marked by its immune and inflammatory 
characteristics. The interleukin-2 (IL-2) cytokine family has a crucial role in 
regulating both neuroinflammation and immune activity, positioning it as one of 
the critical immune pathways in PD. Balancing pro-inflammatory and 
anti-inflammatory signals in PD heavily depends on the IL-2 cytokine family, 
that includes IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21. This balance is vital for 
neuron survival and resistance to degeneration. Disruptions in IL-2 signaling 
can upset the equilibrium among regulatory T cells (Tregs) and pro-inflammatory 
T cells, such as Th1 and Th17, further aggravating the chronic neuroinflammation 
typical of PD. In PD, a decline in IL-2 or receptor dysfunction can hinder Treg 
activity, leading to increased inflammation and neurodegeneration. Similarly, 
IL-15 and IL-21 supports cytotoxic immune cell function, including natural 
killer (NK) cells and CD8+ T cells, which may exacerbate neuronal damage by 
sustaining pro-inflammatory processes. Moreover, IL-4 and IL-7 have 
anti-inflammatory roles in maintaining T cell homeostasis, and their 
dysregulation can contribute to interruption of the blood-brain barrier and 
increased infiltration of immune cells into the central nervous system. 
Targeting the IL-2 cytokine family in Parkinson's disease has shown therapeutic 
potential by expanding Tregs, which reduce neuroinflammation and promote 
dopaminergic neuron survival. Recombinant IL-2 and IL-2/anti-IL-2 complexes have 
demonstrated efficacy in animal models, enhancing Treg function and leading to 
improved neuroprotection. Additionally, IL-4-based therapies have been explored 
for their ability to shift microglia toward a neuroprotective phenotype, further 
enhancing neuronal survival by modulating inflammatory responses and cellular 
metabolism. Current research is exploring how to optimize cytokine delivery 
while minimizing immune side effects, with the goal of developing more targeted 
therapies for PD.

BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease patients have poorer oral health than their 
healthy peers. Insight into their own experiences is vital for improving dental 
care.
OBJECTIVE: To better understand the experiences of Parkinson's disease patients' 
with their oral health and dental care.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven semistructured interviews with Parkinson's disease 
patients from the Netherlands were conducted. Data were analysed using thematic 
analysis to identify recurring themes and patterns.
RESULTS: Participants' narratives revealed challenges in accessing dental 
treatment, primarily due to motor and communication difficulties. They also 
highlighted organisational barriers, such as appointment scheduling and 
awareness of care practitioners about Parkinson's disease patients' oral health. 
Furthermore, they expressed the urgent need for Parkinson's disease-specific 
dental education to (dental) care practitioners and research initiatives that 
focus on Parkinson's disease patients' oral health and dental care.
CONCLUSION: Parkinson's disease patients' experiences highlight the need for 
tailored care interventions and improvements in dental care systems.

BACKGROUND: The efficacy and adverse events (AEs) of bilateral magnetic 
resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) thalamotomies for essential tremor 
(ET) have not been compared to those of deep brain stimulation (DBS). 
Furthermore, it is uncertain whether second-side thalamotomies can be positioned 
differently from the first without compromising effectiveness.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to indirectly compare bilateral MRgFUS and DBS, while 
identifying optimal lesion/stimulation locations.
METHODS: We retrospectively examined 41 ET patients who received either 
bilateral thalamic DBS (n = 22) or MRgFUS (n = 19) surgery. The primary outcome 
was the comparison of modalities for change in Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor 
(CRST) from baseline to post second surgery. We characterized AEs, generated 
probabilistic maps, and tracked streamlines intersecting lesions. First-side 
lesions were always intentionally placed ventrally (z = 0/+2 mm above the 
intercommissural plane [ICP]), and second-side lesions were placed dorsally 
(z = +3 mm above ICP).
RESULTS: Tremor scores improved significantly after second surgeries (MRgFUS: 
56.3 ± 7.1 to 24.2 ± 10.4, P < 0.001; DBS: 58.8 ± 11.6 to 25.0 ± 13, P < 0.05, 
mean follow-up: 23/26 months), with no differences between modalities. Following 
first surgeries, scores were MRgFUS: 37.9 ± 7.9 and DBS: 35.2 ± 13.6, with 
significant improvement from baseline (P < 0.001, mean follow-up: 40/73 months). 
All AEs were grade 1-2, with AE-free rates of 41% for DBS and 32% for MRgFUS. 
First-side lesions exhibited maximal efficacy in the ventral Vim, extending to 
posterior subthalamic area (PSA), whereas second-side lesions demonstrated 
maximal efficacy in the dorsomedial Vim-Vop border. DBS maps corroborated this 
finding and confined to Vim-Vop border. Lesions intersecting with networks 
interconnected with the supplementary motor area, in addition to M1, were 
associated with improved outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The efficacies of bilateral MRgFUS and DBS appear comparable. 
MRgFUS probabilistic maps vary with different targeting methods, revealing two 
distinct sweet spots: dorsal Vim-Vop border and ventral Vim/PSA. © 2025 The

perception of technological interventions among people with Parkinson's disease: 
A systematic review.

OBJECTIVES: The increasing number of technological interventions related to 
Parkinson's disease (PD) signifies growing research interest in the PD 
technological domain. It remains unknown how these interventions could affect 
the psychosocial health of people with PD. This systematic review aims to 
explore how technological interventions affect people with PD psychosocial 
well-being and their perception towards these interventions.
METHOD: A systematic review was conducted using Cochrane Library®, Embase®, IEEE 
Xplore Digital Library®, PsycInfo®, PubMed® and Web of Science® databases 
following PRISMA guidelines. Two individual assessors conducted quality 
appraisals using the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool. Both quantitative narrative 
and qualitative thematic synthesis were adopted to analyse the extracted data.
RESULTS: This review included 27 articles with 752 people with PD, with seven 
categories of technologies implemented in physical rehabilitation. Qualitative 
findings indicated the overarching theme of coping with technological 
intervention. Three themes were identified: user perception of intervention 
design and functional appropriateness, attitude shift and coping, and perceived 
benefits from technological interventions. Unsuccessful coping attempts and 
overcomplicated intervention designs induced negative emotions and affected the 
psychosocial well-being of people with PD.
CONCLUSIONS: Although most PD technological interventions focused on physical 
rehabilitation, people with PD reported a psychosocial gain in improved autonomy 
and reinforced social relationships during the intervention period. A better 
rewardability intervention design was considered more satisfying and could 
promote self-acceptance rather than stress-inducing. Interventions' 
technological complexity should match participants' expectations and 
technological literacy to facilitate the coping process with the intervention 
for people with PD. More research would be required to quantify the reported 
psychosocial gain and examine the technological literacy of people with PD when 
designing a more appropriate intervention regime.

Tubulin Polymerization Promoting Proteins (TPPPs) are highly conserved across 
species but remain poorly understood. There are three TPPP genes in humans, with 
only one homologous TPPP gene in invertebrates, such as Drosophila and C. 
elegans. The human TPPP (TPPP1/p25/p25α) is enriched in the brain and shares 
sequence similarities with the invertebrate TPPPs. TPPP/p25 associates with 
microtubules and plays a pivotal role in microtubule dynamics, bundling, and 
polymerization, thereby stabilizing the microtubular network. This is essential 
for cytoskeletal organization and proper functioning of neurons and glial cells, 
including axonal growth, regeneration, migration, trafficking, synapse 
formation, and myelination of axons. However, studies have also uncovered that 
besides its cytoplasmic/microtubular localization, TPPP/p25 is present in other 
subcellular compartments, including the mitochondria and nucleus, underscoring 
the presence of additional novel functions. At the molecular level, TPPP/p25 is 
predicted to exist as an intrinsically disordered protein and is implicated in 
neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's and related 
disorders and Multiple Sclerosis. In this article, we provide a comprehensive 
overview of TPPP/p25, highlighting its evolutionary conservation, cellular and 
subcellular localization, established and emerging functions in the nervous 
system, interacting partners, potential clinical relevance to human neurological 
disorders, and conclude with unresolved questions and future areas of study.

BACKGROUND: Differentiating progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) from other 
parkinsonian disorders may be challenging.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the role of transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFβ1) 
in PSP.
METHODS: A total of 33 PSP, 39 Parkinson's disease (PD), 8 multiple system 
atrophy (MSA) patients, and 50 healthy controls (HC) were enrolled. TGFβ1 
levels, including both active and inactive forms (latency-associated peptide 
[LAP]-TGFβ1), were measured in serum, total extracellular vesicles (EVs), and 
neuronally-derived EVs (NDEVs) using microfluidic assays and ELISA.
RESULTS: PSP patients exhibited a marked increase in TGFβ1 and LAP-TGFβ1 levels 
in NDEVs, while no differences were observed across groups in serum or total 
EVs. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated outstanding 
performance in differentiating PSP from non-PSP patients (TGFβ1, area under the 
curve [AUC]: 0.97; LAP-TGFβ1, AUC: 1.00), HC, AUC: 1.00).
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights TGFβ1 and LAP-TGFβ1 in NDEVs as promising 
blood-based non-invasive biomarkers for PSP diagnosis, paving the way for 
further research on these proteins in PSP. © 2025 The Author(s). Movement

Alpha-synuclein (αSyn) is an intrinsically disordered protein that accumulates 
in the brains of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Through a 
high-throughput screen, we recently identified 38 genes whose knockdown 
modulates αSyn propagation. Here, we show that, among those, TAX1BP1 regulates 
how αSyn interacts with lipids, and ADAMTS19 modulates how αSyn phase separates 
into inclusions, adding to the growing body of evidence implicating those 
processes in PD. Through RNA sequencing, we identify several genes that are 
differentially expressed after knockdown of TAX1BP1 or ADAMTS19 and carry an 
increased frequency of rare risk variants in patients with PD versus healthy 
controls. Those differentially expressed genes cluster within modules in regions 
of the brain that develop high degrees of αSyn pathology. We propose a model for 
the genetic architecture of sporadic PD: increased burden of risk variants 
across genetic networks dysregulates pathways underlying αSyn homeostasis and 
leads to pathology and neurodegeneration.

BACKGROUND: Delineation of Parkinson's disease (PD) from multiple system atrophy 
(MSA) can be challenging in early disease stages. Speech characteristics have 
been studied as digital biomarkers in PD and ataxias. Currently, data on speech 
in MSA is limited.
OBJECTIVES: To determine whether speech characteristics can serve as a digital 
biomarker to differentiate between MSA and PD.
METHODS: Twenty-one MSA patients and 23 PD patients underwent a battery of 
speech assessments: text reading, sustained phonation and diadochokinetic tasks. 
Speech characteristics were extracted using the software, Praat.
RESULTS: MSA and PD speech can be described by three meaningful factors. MSA 
speech exhibited more reading pauses, higher pitch variability, prolonged 
syllables, and a more irregular speech rhythm, allowing differentiation from PD 
with a ROC-AUC of 0.89. Speech characteristics were correlated with motor 
impairment and disease severity.
CONCLUSION: MSA can be differentiated from PD with good accuracy using speech 
analysis.

BACKGROUND: The burden of Parkinson's disease (PD) and its provincial trends in 
Iran remain unknown. Herein, we explore PD data from the Global Burden of 
Disease (GBD) study nationally and provincially from 1990 to 2021.
METHODS: We used age-standardized incidence (ASIR), prevalence (ASPR), and 
mortality (ASMR) rates to determine disparities and trends overall and by sex, 
age, and geographic locations. Univariate analysis and regression were performed 
to scrutinize the mean differences and associations between socioeconomic 
factors and different PD outcomes.
RESULTS: The ASIR and ASPR of PD increased by 23.1% and 33.2%, respectively, 
from 1990 to 2021, with estimated total percentage change (TPC) of 0.50 (95%CU: 
0.58-0.43) and 0.30 (0.37-0.24), respectively. In 2021, East Azarbayejan had the 
highest ASIR and ASPR. From 1999 to 2021, the ASMR decreased significantly 
across individuals aged below 85 years nationally. Overall, 71.0% provinces 
experienced a downward trend in the ASMR, with the highest decrease in the TPC 
(-0.21,-0.37-0.01) occurring in Markazi. Significant differences in the PD 
outcomes between males and females were noted (P < 0.05). There was a 
significant positive association between the ASPR and the human development 
index (HDI), urbanization rate, and annual income per rural households.
CONCLUSION: From 1999 to 2021, the incidence and prevalence of PD in Iran and 
its provinces increased significantly regardless of age and sex classification. 
Intervention and screening programs should continue to reduce mortality from PD 
in Iran, but with different priorities between provinces.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This narrative review explores the expanding applications of 
neuromodulation beyond pain management, focusing on its use in treating 
non-painful conditions such as heart failure, renal failure, spinal cord 
injuries, overactive bladder syndrome, and cognitive impairment in 
neurodegenerative diseases.
RECENT FINDINGS: Neuromodulation techniques, including dorsal root ganglion 
stimulation, sacral neurostimulation, and deep brain stimulation, have shown 
promising results in various non-painful medical conditions: Heart and Renal 
Failure: Dorsal root ganglion stimulation induces diuresis in diuretic-resistant 
patients, offering a novel approach to managing fluid overload. Spinal Cord 
Injuries: Epidural spinal cord stimulation and brain-spine interfaces have 
demonstrated the potential to restore motor function, enhancing mobility and 
quality of life for paralyzed individuals. Overactive Bladder Syndrome: Sacral 
neurostimulation and tibial nerve stimulation have proven effective in improving 
urinary continence and reducing symptoms in patients unresponsive to 
conventional treatments. Cognitive Impairment in Neurodegenerative Diseases: 
Techniques such as deep brain stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation 
are being investigated for their ability to enhance cognitive and motor 
functions in conditions like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. The review 
highlights the transformative potential of neuromodulation in non-painful 
conditions, demonstrating its ability to address complex medical issues beyond 
its traditional scope. Continued research and optimization of these techniques 
may lead to broader therapeutic applications and improved patient outcomes.

The human endometrium, a dynamic tissue that undergoes cyclical shedding, 
repair, regeneration, and remodeling, relies on progenitor stem cells for 
replenishment. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) also may 
play a crucial role in the physiological process of endometrial regeneration, 
augmenting endometrial repair, supporting pregnancy, and thereby making a major 
contribution to reproduction. Notably, defective or inappropriate recruitment 
and engraftment of stem cells are implicated in various reproductive diseases, 
including endometriosis, highlighting the potential therapeutic avenues offered 
by stem cell-targeted interventions. Endometrial progenitor cells have shown 
promise in improving pregnancy outcomes and addressing infertility issues. 
Furthermore, BM-MSCs demonstrate the potential to reverse pathologies, including 
Asherman's syndrome and thin endometrium, offering novel approaches to treating 
infertility, implantation failure, and recurrent pregnancy loss. Mobilization of 
endogenous stem cells to areas of pathology through chemoattractants also 
presents a promising strategy for targeted therapy. Finally, endometrium-derived 
mesenchymal stem cells, characterized by their multipotent nature and ease of 
collection through minimally invasive techniques, hold promise in a wide range 
of reproductive and non-reproductive pathologies, including diabetes, kidney 
disease, Parkinson's disease, or cardiac disorders. As our knowledge of stem 
cell biology continues to grow, the incorporation of stem cell-based therapies 
into clinical practice presents significant potential to transform reproductive 
medicine and enhance patient outcomes.

Globally, the prevalence of Parkinson's disease (PD) is increasing at an 
unprecedented rate. Therefore, it is imperative to provide evidence on the 
mental well-being of individuals with PD and identify context-specific 
determinants in sub-Saharan Africa to inform future interventions. An 
explanatory sequential mixed-methods design was employed, recruiting 304 
individuals with PD who were receiving follow-up treatment. The prevalence of 
poor mental well-being among participants was 72.5%. Psychiatric manifestations 
included depression with suicidal ideation, anxiety, poor sleep quality, 
cognitive impairment, psychotic symptoms, and emotional and behavioral changes. 
Stigma was significantly associated with poor mental well-being, with an 
adjusted odds ratio of 1.13 (95% CI: 1.07-1.203, P < 0.001). A framework 
illustrating the vicious cycle of PD-related stigma, discrimination, and its 
impact on mental well-being was developed. Routine screening and treatment of 
mental disorders, along with community awareness campaigns to reduce stigma, are 
strongly recommended.Plain language summaryParkinson's disease (PD) exerts a 
significant impact on mental well-being due to its disease process and 
associated social and economic consequences. Therefore, assessing the prevalence 
of poor mental well-being, identifying manifestations of mental illness, and 
examining context-specific determinants in sub-Saharan Africa are essential to 
informing current practices and future research. Findings from this study reveal 
that nearly three-fourths of individuals with PD experience poor mental 
well-being in Ethiopia. Additionally, they exhibit a range of psychiatric 
manifestations, including severe conditions such as hopelessness and suicidal 
ideation. PD-related stigma is an independent determinant of mental well-being. 
People with PD face significant stigma and discrimination, largely driven by 
societal misconceptions about the causes of the disease. Routine screening and 
treatment of mental disorders, alongside the integration of mental health care 
into routine PD management, are essential to addressing the mental health needs 
of individuals with PD. Community awareness initiatives on the causes of PD are 
critically needed to reduce stigma and promote mental well-being. Given the high 
burden of mental disorders and the impact of stigma and discrimination, mental 
health and psychosocial interventions should prioritize individuals with PD.

Transplantation of human fetal ventral mesencephalic tissue in individuals with 
Parkinson's disease has yielded clinical benefits but also side effects, such as 
graft-induced dyskinesias. The open-label TransEuro trial ( NCT01898390 ) was 
designed to determine whether this approach could be further developed into a 
clinically useful treatment. Owing to poor availability of human fetal ventral 
mesencephalic tissue, only 11 individuals were grafted at two centers using the 
same tissue preparation protocol but different implantation devices. No overall 
clinical effect was seen for the primary endpoint 3 years after grafting. No 
major graft-induced dyskinesias were seen, but we observed differences in 
outcome related to transplant device and/or site. Mean dopamine uptake improved 
at 18 months in seven individuals according to [18F]fluorodopa positron emission 
tomography imaging but was restored to near-normal levels in only one 
individual. Our findings highlight the need for a stem cell source of dopamine 
neurons for potential Parkinson's disease cell therapy and provide critical 
insights into how such clinical studies should be approached.

It is still under debate whether levodopa treatment improves speech functions in 
Parkinson's disease (PD). Therefore, speech functions of people with PD were 
compared in medication-OFF condition (withdrawal of PD medication for at least 
12 h) and medication-ON condition (after receiving 200 mg of soluble levodopa). 
A total of 78 participants, including 51 males and 27 females, performed 
predefined standard speech tasks. Acoustic speech features were automatically 
extracted with the algorithm given by the Dysarthria Analyzer. Results suggest 
that acute levodopa intake improves phonatory-respiratory speech functions and 
speech planning abilities, while the articulatory system remains unaffected. 
Furthermore, the study provided preliminary evidence that speech function is 
able to predict the medication status in individuals with PD as the constructed 
speech-based biomarker score did not only correlate with established measures of 
(speech) motor impairment but could also differentiate between the medication 
OFF and ON status. A post-hoc machine learning model yielded similar results.

N'-(1,3-Dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (6PPD), a widely used 
antioxidant in the rubber industry, has garnered global attention due to the 
high toxicity and ecological-health risks posed by its environmental oxidation 
product, 6PPD-quinone (6PPD-Q). With the continuous release of tire wear 
particles (TWPs), 6PPD-Q is ubiquitously distributed in atmospheric, aquatic, 
and terrestrial environments, as well as within organisms, where it 
bioaccumulates through food chains. Notably, 6PPD-Q has been detected in human 
urine, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid, and its association with abnormal 
α-synuclein aggregation in the brains of Parkinson's patients further 
underscores its neurotoxic risks. This review systematically examines the 
environmental occurrence and migration patterns of 6PPD and 6PPD-Q, their 
multisystem toxicity, highly sensitive detection technologies, and pollution 
control strategies, while highlighting critical gaps in current research, such 
as chronic exposure mechanisms, combined pollution effects, and environmental 
safety thresholds. By synthesizing existing knowledge, this review provides a 
scientific foundation for elucidating the ecological and health risks of 6PPD-Q, 
offering critical insights to advance environmental regulatory policies, promote 
green transformation in the rubber industry, and safeguard global ecological 
security. Future research should prioritize long-term toxicity studies, refined 
detection techniques, and sustainable regulatory frameworks to mitigate the 
ecological and health risks posed by these emerging contaminants.

Accumulating evidence suggests that prion-like spread of misfolded α-Synuclein 
(αSyn) underlies the pathological progression of Lewy body diseases (LBD). 
Animal models injected with αSyn preformed fibrils (PFFs) have provided strong 
evidence for the prion hypothesis in LBD. Moreover, αSyn PFFs can be 
administered to various hosts and regions, contributing to the elucidation of 
pathological mechanisms and disease modeling. These models have also been used 
to identify biomarkers and develop new disease-modifying therapies for LBD. In 
contrast, it remains unknown how the prion-like properties of αSyn contribute to 
the pathogenesis of multiple system atrophy (MSA). Recent studies indicate that 
conformationally distinct αSyn fibrils induce different pathological features in 
animals, supporting the strain hypothesis, which suggests that conformational 
variations in αSyn fibrils contribute to the clinicopathological heterogeneity 
in synucleinopathies. However, the study of disease-specific αSyn fibrils in 
pathological mechanisms and disease modeling is still in its early stages. This 
review aims to highlight recent advances in αSyn fibril-seeded animal models 
with an emphasis on their unique features and utility in exploring pathological 
mechanisms and identifying novel disease-modifying therapies. In addition, I 
discuss future directions for refining these models in light of the emerging 
strain hypothesis in synucleinopathies.

In Parkinson's disease (PD), the disturbance of energy metabolism due to glucose 
metabolic reprogramming may be a critical factor contributing to neuronal 
degeneration and death. Glycolysis, as the core process of glucose metabolism, 
not only serves as a fundamental source of energy but also integrates various 
metabolic pathways. However, the precise role of alterations in 
glycolysis-related pathways in the progression of PD remains elusive. We 
compared and analysed datasets from human databases of patients with PD and 
healthy controls to identify differentially expressed genes associated with 
glycolysis. Using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression 
method and multivariate logistic regression analysis, we identified 
glucan-branching enzyme 1 (GBE1) as the most confident glycolytic gene 
implicated in PD. We validated the low expression of GBE1 in 1 - methyl - 4 - 
phenyl - 1,2,3,6 - tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD animal models. 
Stereotaxic injection-mediated overexpression of GBE1 in striatal neurons 
improved motor dysfunction in these animal models. In vitro experiments 
demonstrated that GBE1 promotes the expression of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) 
and lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB), enhances cellular glycolytic flux, and 
thereby increases the viability of PC12 cells under MPP+ treatment. 
Additionally, GBE1 alleviates mitochondrial dysfunction and restores oxidative 
phosphorylation in PD. In summary, by integrating machine learning and 
bioinformatics approaches, we identified GBE1, a glycolysis-related gene with 
significant implications for PD, elucidating its crucial role in glucose 
metabolic reprogramming and identifying potential therapeutic targets for 
modulating glucose metabolism in PD.

Dopamine agonists (DAs), including cabergoline (CAB) and bromocriptine (BRC), 
are the mainstay of treatment for prolactinomas. An underappreciated adverse 
effect associated with DAs is impulse control disorders (ICDs), characterized by 
the development of compulsive behaviors, including hypersexuality, pathological 
gambling, binge eating, compulsive shopping among others, which can negatively 
impact patients' and families' lives. This article reviews the prevalence, risk 
factors, presumed pathophysiology, diagnostic and management strategies for ICDs 
in hyperprolactinemic patients treated with DAs. Electronic literature searches 
were conducted to retrieve pertinent articles for inclusion in this article. The 
reported prevalence of ICDs in patients with prolactinomas or hyperprolactinemia 
on DAs ranges from 7.5% to 46% across studies, with cabergoline being more 
commonly implicated than bromocriptine. Younger age, male sex, and specific 
genetic polymorphisms appear to increase the risk of ICDs. Diagnostic tools, 
such as the Minnesota Impulsivity Disorders Interview (MIDI), the Questionnaire 
for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's disease (QUIP), the Barratt 
Impulsivity Scale-11 (BIS-11), and computer-based tests are instrumental in 
identifying ICDs. Patient education and periodic screening are advisable towards 
early detection. Management strategies for patients who develop ICDs may include 
a decrease in DA dose or medication discontinuation and psychiatric evaluation. 
ICDs may occur in hyperprolactinemic patients on DAs and negatively influence 
their lives, if undetected. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate risk 
factors and underlying mechanisms, and identify effective therapies for managing 
ICDs in patients with hyperprolactinemia on DAs.

The effect of Curcumin-enhanced stem cell exosomes on the learning and memory 
impairment induced by streptozotocin (STZ) and neuro-inflammation in rats was 
evaluated. An animal model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) was established by 
intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of STZ (3 mg/kg) in male Wistar rats 
(250 ± 50 g). ICV STZ injections chronically reduce cerebral glucose uptake and 
produce other effects similar to pathological, molecular and behavioral features 
of AD. Numerous studies confirmed the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant 
properties of curcumin (a natural polyphenol) against free radicals, as well as 
its ability to inhibit the aggregation of proteins such as beta-amyloid and 
alpha-synuclein in disorders such as AD and Parkinson's disease. The use of 
extracellular vesicles has garnered a lot of interest in research studies 
because of the important roles that mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes play 
in permeability, retention, and drug delivery as well as their ability to reduce 
inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6). Furthermore, researches 
highlighted the positive effect of curcumin on neuronal differentiation of stem 
cells in vivo and in vitro. Since studies emphasized the ameliorating effect of 
curcumin-treated macrophage-exosomes on symptoms of Alzheimer's disease by 
inhibiting tau protein phosphorylation, we proposed that Curcumin-primed MSC 
exosomes may offer greater efficacy to alleviate AD compared to naïve MSC 
exosomes. In this study, we investigated the effect of curcumin in stimulating 
the anti-inflammatory potential of exosome-derived stem cells. We evaluated the 
effect of MSC-EXO and pre-treated MSC-EXO with curcumin (CUR-MSC-EXO) on 
inhibiting inflammation and memory and learning impairments. Following four 
intraperitoneal injections of MSC-EXO and CUR-MSC-EXO at a dosage of 30μg/body 
over 30 days, we found that MSC-EXO and CUR-MSC-EXO elevated anti-inflammatory 
cytokines (IL10, TGF-β) and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1, TNF-α) in 
peripheral blood compared to the AD group. The elevated level of M2 
anti-inflammatory microglia markers (Arg1, CD206) and decreased level expression 
of M1 pro-inflammatory markers (iNOS, CD86) indicated that the CUR-MSC-EXO 
effect was more significant in the polarization of microglia into the M2 
phenotype in the rat hippocampus. Both treatment groups demonstrated 
improvements in memory and learning skills. The results of the passive avoidance 
learning in the rats with STZ-induced memory impairment, however, were better in 
the CUR-MSC-EXO. Additionally, after therapy, a decrease in degenerative neurons 
was seen. Therefore, using curcumin may stimulate the anti-inflammatory and 
neuroprotective potential of exosome-derived stem cells which could provide hope 
for Alzheimer's disease treatment in the future.

BACKGROUND: The burden of neurological disorders in China has not been 
systematically analyzed. We aim to provide a comprehensive estimation of the 
national and subnational neurological burden across China from the Global Burden 
of Disease Study (GBD) 2021.
METHODS: We assessed burden estimates for 16 neurological disorders by age, sex, 
and province from 1990 to 2021, with prevalence, death, disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs), years of life lost (YLLs), and years lived with disability 
(YLDs). We performed decomposition analysis to determine contributing factors 
for DALYs and used the socio-demographic index (SDI) to assess relations with 
development level.
FINDINGS: In 2021, there were 468.29 million prevalent cases of neurological 
disorders in China, corresponding to 78.10 million DALYs. Intracerebral 
hemorrhage was the leading cause of DALYs, followed by ischemic stroke, 
dementias, and migraine. DALYs of neurological disorders were higher in males 
than females, peaking at 70-74 years. From 1990 to 2021, the number and 
age-standardized rate of DALYs significantly decreased for idiopathic epilepsy 
and subarachnoid hemorrhage, primarily attributed to the reduction in YLLs, 
while the number of DALYs disproportionately increased for dementias, 
Parkinson's disease, and ischemic stroke contributed by population aging. The 
age-standardized DALY rates of seven neurological disorders had more than 5-fold 
variation between western and eastern provinces, despite reduced burdens with 
rising SDI.
CONCLUSIONS: Neurological disorders pose a large and growing burden on public 
health, primarily driven by population aging. Our findings could inform priority 
setting and targeted strategies to optimize neurological service delivery.

The ability to transplant immunologically foreign cells into an animal without 
immune suppression would be transformative. Pavan et al. show that human 
pluripotent stem cell-derived dopaminergic neuron progenitors engineered to 
express eight immune-evasive proteins can engraft in humanized mice and a rat 
model of Parkinson's disease without recourse to immune suppression.1.

Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. 
While most cases are sporadic, in ~ 5%-10% of PD patients the disease is caused 
by mutations in several genes, among them GBA1 (glucocerebrosidase beta 1) and 
LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2), both prevalent among the Ashkenazi Jewish 
population. LRRK2-associated PD tends to be milder than GBA1-associated PD. 
Several recent clinical studies have suggested that carriers of both GBA1 and 
LRRK2 mutations develop milder PD compared to that observed among GBA1 carriers. 
These findings strongly suggested an interplay between the two genes in the 
development and progression of PD. In the present study Drosophila was employed 
as a model to investigate the impact of mutations in the LRRK2 gene on mutant 
GBA1-associated PD. Our results strongly indicated that flies expressing both 
mutant genes exhibited milder parkinsonian signs compared to the disease 
developed in flies expressing only a GBA1 mutation. This was corroborated by a 
decrease in the ER stress response, increase in the number of dopaminergic 
cells, elevated levels of tyrosine hydroxylase, reduced neuroinflammation, 
improved locomotion and extended survival. Furthermore, a significant decrease 
in the steady-state levels of mutant GBA1-encoded GCase was observed in the 
presence of mutant LRRK2, strongly implying a role for mutant LRRK2 in 
degradation of mutant GCase.

Alpha-synucleinopathies, characterized by extracellular alpha-synuclein (αSyn or 
SNCA) accumulation and aggregation, have been linked to neurological disorders 
including Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy. P2RX7 is a 
non-selective cationic transmembrane purinergic receptor activated by elevated 
levels of extracellular ATP, which typically occurs during inflammatory 
conditions. Activation of P2RX7 by αSyn is implicated in neuronal degeneration, 
potentially causing pore dilation and increased inflammation. By integrating the 
data curation, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, along 
with structural analyses, we attempted to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and 
binding sites for P2RX7-αSyn interaction. We elucidated interactions between 
P2RX7 and the N-terminal domain (NTD) of αSyn. Utilizing cryo-EM structures of 
P2RX7 in ATP-bound and unbound states, we assessed αSyn's effect on P2RX7 
structural and functional dynamics. Initially, the analyses revealed that αSyn 
interactomes are mainly involved in mitochondrial functions, while P2RX7 
interactors are linked to receptor internalization and calcium transport. 
Molecular docking with six tools identified that αSyn-NTD fragments 
preferentially bind to the proximal region of P2RX7's transmembrane domain. 
Microsecond all atom MD simulations in a POPS lipid bilayer showed significant 
atomic fluctuations, particularly in the head region, lower body, and large loop 
of P2RX7's cytoplasmic domain. Secondary structure analysis indicated unfolding 
in regions related to pore dilation and receptor desensitization. Further by 
contact-based and solvent accessibility analyses, along with protein structure 
network (PSN) studies, we identified crucial residues involved in αSyn-P2RX7 
interactions. This understanding enhances the knowledge of how αSyn and P2RX7 
interactions take place, potentially contributing to neurodegenerative diseases, 
and could be instrumental in developing future preventive and therapeutic 
approaches.

: Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) measures magnetic susceptibility of 
tissues, aiding in the detection of pathologies like traumatic brain injury, 
cerebral microbleeds, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis, through 
analysis of variations in substances such as iron and calcium. Despite its 
clinical value, using high-resolution QSM (voxel sizes < 1 mm3) reduces 
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which compromises diagnostic quality.
METHODS: Denoising of T2* -weighted (T2*) data was implemented using 
Marchenko-Pastur Principal Component Analysis (MP-PCA), allowing to enhance the 
quality of R2*, T2*, and QSM maps. Proof of concept of the denoising technique 
was demonstrated on a numerical phantom, healthy subjects, and patients with 
brain metastases and sickle cell anemia.
RESULTS: Effective and robust denoising was observed across different scan 
settings, offering higher SNR and improved accuracy. Noise propagation was 
analyzed between T2*w, R2*, and T2* values, revealing augmentation of noise in 
T2*w compared to R2* values.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of MP-PCA denoising allows the collection of high 
resolution (∼0.5 mm3) QSM data at clinical scan times, without compromising SNR.
SIGNIFICANCE: The presented pipeline could enhance the diagnosis of various 
neurological diseases by providing higher-definition mapping of small vessels 
and of variations in iron or calcium.

BACKGROUND: Dance for Parkinson's Disease (DfPD) is a dance program for 
individuals with Parkinson disease (PD). There is a lack of knowledge about the 
effect of this program on frailty and sarcopenia experienced by patients with 
PD. In addition, no randomized controlled trial to date has investigated either 
the possible differential effects of in-person versus online DfPD or the 
possible effects of DfPD on clinical parameters in Greek patients with PD.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the efficacy, safety, and feasibility of a 
culturally tailored and patient-centered DfPD program offered both in-person and 
online to Greek patients with early- to midstage PD.
METHODS: This is a 3-arm crossover randomized controlled trial (in-person DfPD 
vs online DfPD vs control) of UPGRADE-PD (Upbeating Greek Application of Dance 
in Parkinson's Disease). The experimental period will be 10 months, including 
three 2-month interventional periods of two 60-minute dance classes per week for 
each group (in-person DfPD vs online DfPD) versus a control group 
(nonintervention group), and two 2-month washout periods between each group for 
40 Greek patients with early- to midstage PD. Assessments will be performed 
face-to-face at baseline and at the end of each study period and will include 
quality of life, fatigue, depressive symptoms, stress, anxiety, sarcopenia, 
frailty, balance, cognitive functions, movement and nonmovement PD symptoms, and 
BMI. Safety, feasibility, and patient satisfaction for each dance intervention 
(in-person DfPD vs online DfPD) will be assessed as well.
RESULTS: The study protocol was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the 
Eginition University Hospital in September 2022 and the Research and Ethics 
Committee of the University of West Attica in October 2023 and funded in 
September 2023. The first participant was enrolled in April 2023, and the trial 
is currently ongoing and will conclude in September 2024.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study are expected to show the possible 
differential effect of a patient-centered and culturally tailored in-person vs 
online DfPD intervention on several movement and nonmovement symptoms, as well 
as on quality of life, sarcopenia, and frailty in people living with PD in 
Greece.

Aging is a physiological process that culminates in cellular senescence, a 
phenomenon that has significant implications for health and longevity. 
Plant-based therapeutics, particularly the root of Withania somnifera, have been 
reported to delay the onset and progression of aging and its associated 
disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and other 
neurodegenerative disorders. However, the role of leaf-derived microRNAs 
(miRNAs) from W. somnifera in the molecular regulation of genes involved in 
aging remains poorly understood. Caenorhabditis elegans serves as an 
indispensable model organism for studying aging-associated gene regulation due 
to its short lifespan, conserved human orthologs, and ease of laboratory 
cultivation. In this study, we explored the regulatory interactions between 
miRNAs derived from the leaf tissues of W. somnifera and aging-associated genes, 
utilizing C. elegans as a model organism. We employed bioinformatics to identify 
miRNAs that interact with aging-associated genes in C. elegans and found that 
three specific miRNAs in the leaf tissue of W. somnifera interacted with these 
genes. To assess the physiological effects of these miRNAs on C. elegans, we 
conducted biochemical assays, including lifespan, chemotaxis, and stress 
resistance assays. Additionally, we investigated the differential gene 
expression of the interacting genes in the presence and absence of W. somnifera 
leaf miRNA treatment using real-time PCR. The results indicated that the 
expression levels of the age-1 and sel-12 genes were significantly 
downregulated, while the apl-1 gene was upregulated following treatment with 
leaf miRNAs in C. elegans. These findings suggest that miRNAs derived from W. 
somnifera leaves may play a crucial role in regulating aging-associated gene 
expression. This is the first study, to our knowledge, that identifies the 
miRNAs of W. somnifera leaf involved in aging-associated gene regulation, 
thereby paving the way for future research into the therapeutic potential of 
plant-derived miRNAs in combating age-related disorders.

Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most common cause of 
familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD). While the clinical features of 
patients with LRRK2-PD resemble those of typical PD, there are significant 
differences in the pathological findings. The pathological hallmark of definite 
PD is the presence of α-synuclein (αSYN)-positive Lewy-related pathology; 
however, approximately half of patients with LRRK2-PD do not have Lewy-related 
pathology. Lewy-related pathology is a late-stage αSYN aggregation that can be 
visualized with hematoxylin and eosin stains or conventional 
immunohistochemistry (IHC). Increasing evidence has indicated that αSYN 
oligomers, which represent the early-stage of αSYN aggregation, may have 
neurotoxicity. Visualization of αSYN oligomers requires specialized staining 
techniques, such as αSYN-proximity ligation assay (PLA). Distribution and 
severity of αSYN oligomers in the brain of patients with LRRK2-PD remain 
unknown. In this study, we performed phosphorylated αSYN-IHC and αSYN-PLA 
staining on postmortem brain sections of patients with three pathogenic LRRK2 
mutants: p.G2019S (n = 5), p.I2020T (n = 5), and p.R1441C (n = 4). The severity 
of Lewy-related pathology and αSYN oligomers was assessed semi-quantitatively in 
the brainstem, limbic lobe, basal ganglia, and cerebral cortex. αSYN oligomers 
were detected in patients with LRRK2-PD even in those without Lewy-related 
pathology; a negative correlation was observed between Lewy-related pathology 
and αSYN oligomers (r = - 0.26 [- 0.39, - 0.12]; P < 0.0001). Our findings 
suggest that αSYN oligomers may represent a common pathological feature of 
LRRK2-PD. Notably, patients harboring p.G2019S and p.I2020T had significantly 
higher levels of αSYN oligomers in those without Lewy-related pathology compared 
to those with Lewy-related pathology. These patients also had a trend toward 
shorter disease duration. These results imply that in LRRK2-PD, αSYN oligomers 
may initially accumulate in the brain but do not progress to form Lewy-related 
pathology. The present study suggests that targeting αSYN oligomers may be a 
therapeutic strategy for LRRK2-PD even if there is no Lewy-related pathology.

Lewy body diseases are common neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's 
disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies, which lead to both motor and 
non-motor symptoms. They are neuropathologically characterized by loss of 
neuromelanized neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and 
α-synuclein-immunopositive inclusions (Lewy bodies) in several types of neurons 
in the brain. A fraction of monogenic PD cases, however, represent a conundrum, 
as they can present with clinical Lewy body disease but do not have Lewy bodies 
upon neuropathological examination. For LRRK2, the presence or absence of Lewy 
bodies is not related to any specific mutation in the gene and different 
clinical presentation and neuropathology can be present even in the same family. 
Here, we present the first evidence of widespread α-synuclein accumulation 
detected with proximity ligation assay (PLA) using the MJFR14-6-4-2 antibody in 
six Lewy body-negative LRRK2 cases and compare the levels with five patients 
with neuropathologically verified Lewy body disease and six healthy controls. We 
show that non-inclusion aggregated α-synuclein in the form of particulate PLA 
signal is dominant in the LRRK2 cases, while both Lewy-like and particulate PLA 
signal is found in late-stage Lewy body disease. Furthermore, LRRK2 cases 
displayed prominent particulate PLA signal in pontocerebellar tracts and 
inferior olivary nuclei in the brainstem, which was not seen in idiopathic Lewy 
body disease cases. These results suggest that Lewy-body negative LRRK2-related 
PD is not associated with a lack of α-synuclein aggregation in neurons but 
rather a deficiency in the formation of inclusions.

BACKGROUD: Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is not rare in patients with Parkinson's 
disease (PD). To date, there have been few studies on the association of genetic 
variants with OH.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the association of LRRK2 and GBA variants with 
OH in a large PD cohort.
METHODS: This study utilized data from the PPMI database, including 863 
participants who were divided into the sporadic PD patients (sPD, n = 357), GBA 
variant carriers (GBA-PD, n = 137), LRRK2 variant carriers (LRRK2-PD, n = 158) 
and healthy controls (HC, n = 211). LRRK2-PD patients were additionally 
categorized into G2019S (n = 141) and R1441G (n = 16). GBA-PD patients were 
categorized into three subgroups by the genomic categorization.
RESULTS: No significant difference was found in the incidence of OH among the 
four groups at baseline. Lower University of Pennsylvania Scent Identification 
Test (UPSIT) scores, higher Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder Screening 
Questionnaire (RBDSQ) score and the risk GBA mutations were significantly 
associated with OH cross-sectionally. Higher Movement Disorder Society Unified 
Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) total and part II scores, higher 
Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) scores, higher RBDSQ scores and higher Scales for 
Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease-Autonomic Questionnaire (SCOPA-AUT) scores were 
strongly linked with OH progression over time. LRRK2 mutations especially LRRK2 
G2019S mutation were significantly associated with the lower risk of OH 
progression.
CONCLUSION: LRRK2-PD, particularly the LRRK2-G2019S-PD, were found to have a 
lower risk of OH. In contrast, the role of GBA mutations in OH appears more 
complex, with no further evidence to suggest that GBA is associated with the 
progression of OH in PD.

The role of gut microbiota-mitochondria crosstalk in neurodegeneration: 
Underlying mechanisms and potential therapies.

Emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiota is closely associated with 
the pathological manifestations of multiple neurodegenerative diseases via the 
gut-brain axis, which refers to the crosstalk between the gut and the central 
nervous system. More importantly, mitochondria have been considered prominent 
mediators of the interplay between the gut microbiota and the brain. Intestinal 
microbes may modulate mitochondrial function in the central nervous system to 
affect the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondria are essential 
for meeting the host's substantial neuronal metabolic demands, maintaining 
excitability, and facilitating synaptic transmission. Dysfunctional mitochondria 
are considered critical hallmarks of various neurodegenerative diseases. 
Therefore, this review provides novel insights into the intricate roles of gut 
microbiota-mitochondrial crosstalk in the underlying mechanisms during the 
progression of neurodegeneration, as well as the existing potential therapeutic 
strategies for neurodegenerative disorders. These suggest intestinal 
microbiota-mitochondrial interaction play a crucial role in the occurrence and 
development of neurodegenerative diseases, and targeting this interaction may be 
a promising therapeutic approach to neurodegenerative diseases. However, this 
review found that there was relatively little research on the effect of this 
crosstalk on other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington's disease and 
Multiple sclerosis, and the potential therapeutic strategies were translated 
into clinical trials, which face many challenges in developing personalized 
treatment plans based on the unique gut microbiota of different individuals.

Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are central to the pathogenesis 
of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and 
Huntington's diseases. Neurons, particularly dopaminergic (DAergic) ones, are 
highly vulnerable to mitochondrial stress; however, the cellular and molecular 
mechanisms underlying this vulnerability remain poorly understood. Previously, 
we demonstrated that protein kinase C delta (PKCδ) is highly expressed in 
DAergic neurons and mediates apoptotic cell death during neurotoxic stress via 
caspase-3-mediated proteolytic activation. Herein, we further uncovered a key 
downstream molecular event of PKCδ signaling following mitochondrial dysfunction 
that governs neuronal cell death by dissembling nuclear architecture. Exposing 
N27 DAergic cells to the mitochondrial complex-1 inhibitor tebufenpyrad (Tebu) 
induced PKCδ phosphorylation at the T505 activation loop accompanied by 
caspase-3-dependent proteolytic activation. High-resolution 3D confocal 
microscopy revealed that proteolytically activated cleaved PKCδ translocates to 
the nucleus, colocalizing with Lamin B1. Electron microscopy also visualized 
nuclear membrane damage in Tebu-treated N27 cells. In silico analyses identified 
threonine site on Lamin B1 (T575) as a phosphorylation site of PKCδ. 
Interestingly, N27 DAergic cells stably expressing a PKCδ cleavage-resistant 
mutant failed to induce nuclear damage, PKCδ activation, and Lamin B1 
phosphorylation. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9-based stable knockdown of PKCδ greatly 
attenuated Tebu-induced Lamin B1 phosphorylation. Also, studies using the Lamin 
B1T575G phosphorylation mutant and PKCδ-ΔNLS-overexpressing N27 cells showed 
that PKCδ activation and translocation to the nuclear membrane are essential for 
phosphorylating Lamin B1 at T575 to induce nuclear membrane damage during Tebu 
insult. Additionally, Tebu failed to induce Lamin B1 damage and Lamin B1 
phosphorylation in organotypic midbrain slices cultured from PKCδ-/- mouse pups. 
Postmortem analyses of PD brains revealed significantly higher PKCδ activation, 
Lamin B1 phosphorylation, and Lamin B1 loss in nigral DAergic neurons compared 
to age-matched healthy controls, demonstrating the translational relevance of 
these findings. Collectively, our data reveal that PKCδ functions as a Lamin B1 
kinase to disassemble the nuclear membrane during mitochondrial stress-induced 
neuronal death. This mechanistic insight may have important implications for the 
etiology of age-related neurodegenerative diseases resulting from mitochondrial 
dysfunction as well as for the development of novel treatment strategies.

Pig islet xenotransplantation in nonhuman primates (NHPs) has made considerable 
progress during the past 30 years, and European scientists in both Europe and 
the USA have contributed to this progress. At times, there have been, or are, 
active research programs in Sweden, Germany, Belgium, and the USA. The first 
clinical experiments of wild-type (i.e., genetically-unmodified) pig islet 
xenotransplantation were carried out by Groth and his colleagues in Stockholm in 
1994, but without significant success. Hering's group in Minneapolis was the 
first to report prolonged survival of wild-type pig islets in NHPs in 2006, and 
the first report of insulin-independence for >12 months was by a "European" 
research team at the University of Pittsburgh in 2009. Recent progress has been 
slow, in part through a lack of funding, but recent advances in pig organ 
xenotransplantation suggest that pig islet xenotransplantation is poised for 
clinical experiments in the near future. In addition, there have been 
encouraging experimental studies of pig neural cell injections into the brains 
of monkeys with a pharmacologically-induced Parkinson's disease.

The misfolding, aggregation, and deposition of alpha-synuclein into Lewy bodies 
are pivotal events that trigger pathological changes in Parkinson's disease. 
Extracellular vesicles are nanosized lipidbilayer vesicles secreted by cells 
that play a crucial role in intercellular communication due to their diverse 
cargo. Among these, brain-derived extracellular vesicles, which are secreted by 
various brain cells such as neurons, glial cells, and Schwann cells, have 
garnered increasing attention. They serve as a promising tool for elucidating 
Parkinson's disease pathogenesis and for advancing diagnostic and therapeutic 
strategies. This review highlights the recent advancements in our understanding 
of brain-derived extracellular vesicles released into the blood and their role 
in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, with specific emphasis on their 
involvement in the aggregation and spread of alpha-synuclein. Brain-derived 
extracellular vesicles contribute to disease progression through multiple 
mechanisms, including autophagy-lysosome dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and 
oxidative stress, collectively driving neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. 
Their application in Parkinson's disease diagnosis is a primary focus of this 
review. Recent studies have demonstrated that brainderived extracellular 
vesicles can be isolated from peripheral blood samples, as they carry 
α-synuclein and other key biomarkers such as DJ-1 and various microRNAs. These 
findings highlight the potential of brain-derived extracellular vesicles, not 
only for the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease but also for disease 
progression monitoring and differential diagnosis. Additionally, an overview of 
explorations into the potential therapeutic applications of brain-derived 
extracellular vesicles for Parkinson's disease is provided. Therapeutic 
strategies targeting brain-derived extracellular vesicles involve modulating the 
release and uptake of pathological alpha-synuclein -containing brain-derived 
extracellular vesicles to inhibit the spread of the protein. Moreover, 
brain-derived extracellular vesicles show immense promise as therapeutic 
delivery vehicles capable of transporting drugs into the central nervous system. 
Importantly, brain-derived extracellular vesicles also play a crucial role in 
neural regeneration by promoting neuronal protection, supporting axonal 
regeneration, and facilitating myelin repair, further enhancing their 
therapeutic potential in Parkinson's disease and other neurological disorders. 
Further clarification is needed of the methods for identifying and extracting 
brain-derived extracellular vesicles, and large-scale cohort studies are 
necessary to validate the accuracy and specificity of these biomarkers. Future 
research should focus on systematically elucidating the unique mechanistic roles 
of brain-derived extracellular vesicles, as well as their distinct advantages in 
the clinical translation of methods for early detection and therapeutic 
development.

The cure rate for chronic neurodegenerative diseases remains low, creating an 
urgent need for improved intervention methods. Recent studies have shown that 
enhancing mitochondrial function can mitigate the effects of these diseases. 
This paper comprehensively reviews the relationship between mitochondrial 
dysfunction and chronic neurodegenerative diseases, aiming to uncover the 
potential use of targeted mitochondrial interventions as viable therapeutic 
options. We detail five targeted mitochondrial intervention strategies for 
chronic neurodegenerative diseases that act by promoting mitophagy, inhibiting 
mitochondrial fission, enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis, applying 
mitochondria-targeting antioxidants, and transplanting mitochondria. Each method 
has unique advantages and potential limitations, making them suitable for 
various therapeutic situations. Therapies that promote mitophagy or inhibit 
mitochondrial fission could be particularly effective in slowing disease 
progression, especially in the early stages. In contrast, those that enhance 
mitochondrial biogenesis and apply mitochondria-targeting antioxidants may offer 
great benefits during the middle stages of the disease by improving cellular 
antioxidant capacity and energy metabolism. Mitochondrial transplantation, while 
still experimental, holds great promise for restoring the function of damaged 
cells. Future research should focus on exploring the mechanisms and effects of 
these intervention strategies, particularly regarding their safety and efficacy 
in clinical settings. Additionally, the development of innovative 
mitochondria-targeting approaches, such as gene editing and nanotechnology, may 
provide new solutions for treating chronic neurodegenerative diseases. 
Implementing combined therapeutic strategies that integrate multiple 
intervention methods could also enhance treatment outcomes.

Cmyc, a proto-oncogene, is expressed at extremely low levels in mature neurons 
and is traditionally thought to have no function in these cells. However, recent 
studies suggest that Cmyc may play a crucial role in maintaining the health and 
function of mature dopaminergic neurons. This study assessed the role of Cmyc in 
dopaminergic neurons and its significance in Parkinson's disease. We used a 
conditional knockout approach to specifically delete Cmyc in substantia nigra 
dopaminergic neurons of adult mice. Our findings showed that Cmyc deletion led 
to progressive neuron loss, Parkinson's disease-like symptoms, downregulation of 
Klotho, and upregulation of senescence-associated inflammatory factors, along 
with enhanced oxidative stress and nitrated alpha-synuclein accumulation, 
ultimately causing neuronal death. In vitro experiments confirmed increased 
senescence in C-MYC knockout cells, which was partially reversible by KLOTHO 
overexpression. We conclude that low-level Cmyc expression is essential for 
maintaining the health of mature dopaminergic neurons and preventing 
neurodegeneration, and suggest the c-Myc/Klotho axis as a potential therapeutic 
target for age-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's 
disease. Our study introduces a novel mouse model for Parkinson's disease that 
replicates a condition associated with normal aging, offering a valuable tool 
for future research into disease mechanisms and therapeutic strategies.

Short-chain fatty acids mediate enteric and central nervous system homeostasis 
in Parkinson's disease: innovative therapies and their translation.

Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.

Short-chain fatty acids, metabolites produced by the fermentation of dietary 
fiber by gut microbiota, have garnered significant attention due to their 
correlation with neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Parkinson's disease. 
In this review, we summarize the changes in short-chain fatty acid levels and 
the abundance of short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria in various samples 
from patients with Parkinson's disease, highlighting the critical role of gut 
homeostasis imbalance in the pathogenesis and progression of the disease. 
Focusing on the nervous system, we discuss the molecular mechanisms by which 
short-chain fatty acids influence the homeostasis of both the enteric nervous 
system and the central nervous system. We identify key processes, including the 
activation of G protein-coupled receptors and the inhibition of histone 
deacetylases by short-chain fatty acids. Importantly, structural or functional 
disruptions in the enteric nervous system mediated by these fatty acids may lead 
to abnormal α-synuclein expression and gastrointestinal dysmotility, which could 
serve as an initiating event in Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, we propose 
that short-chain fatty acids help establish communication between the enteric 
nervous system and the central nervous system via the vagal nerve, immune 
circulation, and endocrine signaling. This communication may shed light on their 
potential role in the transmission of α-synuclein from the gut to the brain. 
Finally, we elucidate novel treatment strategies for Parkinson's disease that 
target short-chain fatty acids and examine the challenges associated with 
translating short-chain fatty acid-based therapies into clinical practice. In 
conclusion, this review emphasizes the pivotal role of short-chain fatty acids 
in regulating gut-brain axis integrity and their significance in the 
pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease from the perspective of the nervous system. 
Moreover, it highlights the potential value of short-chain fatty acids in early 
intervention for Parkinson's disease. Future research into the molecular 
mechanisms of short-chain fatty acids and their synergistic interactions with 
other gut metabolites is likely to advance the clinical translation of 
innovative short-chain fatty acid-based therapies for Parkinson's disease.
